"Banksy  Arrested   Real Identity Revealed  Is The Same Hoax From Last Year If you’ve seen a story floating around on your Facebook feed about Banksy getting arrested and exposed  don’t worry because Banksy is still anonymous and well The hoax was the work of a “satirical” news site called The National Report — which I’m not linking because f ck those guys — that makes up fake stories that sound like they could be ostensibly true  usually without a trace of actual satire  as filthy  filthy clickbait It’s an awful yet unfortunately effective business model In a story which was published early this morning  The National Report claimed that Banksy was arrested in London by a 24 hour Anti Graffiti Task Force and revealed to be a 35 year old man named Paul Horner The International Business Times did some quick fact checking and exposed the story to be a hoax 

Paul Horner is the name given to a Facebook spokesperson who said the site will soon be charging users  2 99 a month – another hoax story that comes around every now and again – as well as the name from a hoax story about a 15 year old Louisiana teen who was sentenced to 25 years to life after he called a SWAT team to another teenager’s house after he beat him while playing Battlefield 4 The article is also said to have been written by Dr Darius Rubics  a fake name for a writer who claims to have be a Pulitzer prize winning reporter but who  unsurprisingly since his previous stories include ‘Obama Declares November National Muslim Appreciation Month’ and ‘Dennis Rodman Leaves US To Talk With Leaders Of Isis’  has never been awarded any prizes for excellence in journalism HAHA get it It’s funny because it’s not true I guess there’s some logic in there somewhere It’s not even entertaining to see people share stories that come from places like the The National Report since they’re designed to trick — unlike when dumb people share stories from The Onion  which are designed to actually be satire Again  and I cannot stress this enough  F ck those guys ",0,2

"11 Tripoli Planes Still Missing  Sparks 9 11 Concerns Eleven planes missing from Tripoli Airport after it was taken by Islamic rebels

U S  officials warn planes could be used to carry out terror attacks on 9 11

September 11 also marks anniversary of attack on US embassy in Libya

Libyan terrorists have posted pictures of themselves online posing with some of the aeroplanes taken from Tripoli airport after fighters seized it last month Soldiers from the group Libyan Dawn can be seen climbing on to the wings of commercial jets while smiling and waving for the camera U S  officials fear that these aeroplanes could now be used to carry out 9 11 style attacks in the region on the anniversary of the tragedy this month A total of 11 commercial jets from state owned carriers Libyan Airlines and Afriqiyah Airways went missing in August after militants from the so called  masked men brigade  overran the airport Scroll down for video

Islamists from the rebel group Libyan Dawn have posed with aeroplanes seized from Tripoli Airport last month

Authorities say 11 aircraft taken from Tripoli airport could now be used in terror attacks in the region

In pictures posted online Jihadi soldiers can be seen clambering over aircraft at Tripoli airport At least 11 planes went missing after the airport fell at the end of last month

Tripoli airport was left as little more than a smouldering ruin after rebels seized control of it in August

Officials have been warning for some time about the deteriorating situation in Libya  which was controlled by dictator Muammar Gaddaffi until he was killed in October 2011  There are a number of commercial airliners in Libya that are missing  one official told the Washington Free Beacon  We found out on September 11 what can happen with hijacked planes September 11 not only marks the anniversary of the attacks on the World Trade Center but it will also be the second anniversary of the raid of the U S Ambassador s compound in Benghazi  Libya Four Americans were killed in the attack  including U S Ambassador Christopher Stevens Ansar al Shariah  the group Washington holds responsible for the attack  have also seized parts of the Libyan capital and are known to work with terrorists from ISIS However they are not thought to be working with fighters from Libyan Dawn  as they are an Al Qaeda affiliated group The inside of the main building at Tripoli airport gutted by fire following an attack by Islamist militants

Images posted on Twitter show a fire raging inside one of the terminal buildings as militants attacked

Militias which once fought to oust Muammar Gaddaffi from power in 2011 are now warring between themselves for control of the volatile country

Libyan Dawn  an Al Qaeda affiliated group  are now in control of part of Tripoli  as are Ansar al Shariah  the group held responsible for the 2012 attack on the US embassy in Libya

Tripoli International Airport was being run by two anti Islamist militias and had been closed since mid July when it was taken over at the end of August by the group Libyan Dawn Pictures show the aftermath of the firefight  with planes completely or partially blasted and several littered with bullet holes Tripoli is witnessing one of its worst spasms of violence since Gaddaffi left power The militias  many of which originate from rebel forces that fought Gaddaffi  became powerful players in post war Libya  filling a void left by weak police and a shattered army Successive governments have put militias on their payroll in return for maintaining order  but rivalries over control and resources have led to fierce fighting among them and posed a constant challenge to the central government and a hoped for transition to democracy On Sunday  the Libyan government announced that they had lost control of the capital Ansar al Sharia has ties to the Islamic State  also known as ISIS  the Syrian group which today released the filmed beheading of American journalist Steven Sotloff   the second recorded execution of a U S  hostage by the group Fighters from Al Qaeda affiliated group Libyan Dawn pose on top of a heavily armoured truck as Tripoli Airport burns in the background following fighting there last month

Fears  Nearly a dozen commercial planes are missing in Libya after a radical Islamic group overtook the international airport in the capital of Tripoli late last month Aftermath  Tripoli International Airport was overtaken by the group Libyan Dawn last month and now 11 aircraft for Libyan Airlines and Afriqiyah Airways are missing

Moroccan military expert Abderrahmane Mekkaoui told Al Jazeera television after the airport attack that the planes had been taken by another Islamic group  the Masked Men Brigade Mekkaoui said there is  credible intelligence  that the Masked Men Brigade  is plotting to use the planes in attacks on the Maghreb state  on the 9 11 anniversary Sebastian Gorka  a counterterrorism expert  told the Free Beacon that the planes could be used in two ways to strike North Africa or even as far as the oil fields of Saudi Arabia  The first would be how commercial airliners were used on Sept 11  2001  literally turning an innocent mode of mass transit into a super high precision guided missile of immense potency  Gorka  the Maj Gen Charles Horner chair at the Marine Corps University  said Strike again A Moroccan military expert believes Islamic group The Masked Men Brigade are in control of the 11 missing airplanes

 The second tactic could be to use the airframe with its civilian markings as a tool of deception to insert a full payload of armed terrorists into a locale that otherwise is always open to commercial carriers  he added U S  officials have not publicly confirmed the eleven planes  disappearance  but are reportedly working to track them down Since the overthrow of previous dictator Muammar Gaddafi  Libya has descended into turmoil and officials fear it may become another safe haven for terrorists  like Syria Egypt s military government is currently looking into intervening in the country to restore order The U S  is taking a more conservative role in the country  but Secretary of State John Kerry said last week that he would be delivering Apache attack helicopters to Egypt ",0,14

Dramatic footage has emerged of a US marine being shot in the head by a Taliban sniper  only to be saved by his Kevlar helmet The video was captured on the helmet camera of a marine in 2013  when he and two other marines were taking part in a reconnaissance mission in the NawZad district of the renowned Helmand Province  Afghanistan The video begins with the team searching a compound  however  when they hear gunfire they decide to investigate where it is coming from After walking through a tunnel the team fall quiet  before the silence is broken by the sound of a sniper’s bullet ricocheting off one of the marine’s Kevlar helmets The team quickly fall back to safety using the radio to explain what has just happened When in a safe area  the bewildered marine asks  “What just happened ”

“Dude  you got shut” the marine with the camera tells him  “I saw it hit your Kevlar ”

It s a sentiment echoed by Wilfried Strauch  an adviser to Nicaragua s Institute of Territorial Studies  or Ineter  who concluded that it s  very strange that no one reported a streak of light  We have to ask if anyone has a photo or something  he said It also appears that a meteor landing in Nicaragua could not have come from asteroid 2014 RC  also nicknamed  Pitbull  as first thought National Geographic writes

U S  officials warn planes could be used to carry out terror attacks on 9 11

September 11 also marks anniversary of attack on US embassy in Libya

Libyan terrorists have posted pictures of themselves online posing with some of the aeroplanes taken from Tripoli airport after fighters seized it last month Soldiers from the group Libyan Dawn can be seen climbing on to the wings of commercial jets while smiling and waving for the camera U S  officials fear that these aeroplanes could now be used to carry out 9 11 style attacks in the region on the anniversary of the tragedy this month A total of 11 commercial jets from state owned carriers Libyan Airlines and Afriqiyah Airways went missing in August after militants from the so called  masked men brigade  overran the airport Scroll down for video

Islamists from the rebel group Libyan Dawn have posed with aeroplanes seized from Tripoli Airport last month

Authorities say 11 aircraft taken from Tripoli airport could now be used in terror attacks in the region

In pictures posted online Jihadi soldiers can be seen clambering over aircraft at Tripoli airport At least 11 planes went missing after the airport fell at the end of last month

Tripoli airport was left as little more than a smouldering ruin after rebels seized control of it in August

Officials have been warning for some time about the deteriorating situation in Libya  which was controlled by dictator Muammar Gaddaffi until he was killed in October 2011  There are a number of commercial airliners in Libya that are missing  one official told the Washington Free Beacon  We found out on September 11 what can happen with hijacked planes September 11 not only marks the anniversary of the attacks on the World Trade Center but it will also be the second anniversary of the raid of the U S Ambassador s compound in Benghazi  Libya Four Americans were killed in the attack  including U S Ambassador Christopher Stevens Ansar al Shariah  the group Washington holds responsible for the attack  have also seized parts of the Libyan capital and are known to work with terrorists from ISIS However they are not thought to be working with fighters from Libyan Dawn  as they are an Al Qaeda affiliated group The inside of the main building at Tripoli airport gutted by fire following an attack by Islamist militants

Images posted on Twitter show a fire raging inside one of the terminal buildings as militants attacked

Militias which once fought to oust Muammar Gaddaffi from power in 2011 are now warring between themselves for control of the volatile country

Libyan Dawn  an Al Qaeda affiliated group  are now in control of part of Tripoli  as are Ansar al Shariah  the group held responsible for the 2012 attack on the US embassy in Libya

Tripoli International Airport was being run by two anti Islamist militias and had been closed since mid July when it was taken over at the end of August by the group Libyan Dawn Pictures show the aftermath of the firefight  with planes completely or partially blasted and several littered with bullet holes Tripoli is witnessing one of its worst spasms of violence since Gaddaffi left power The militias  many of which originate from rebel forces that fought Gaddaffi  became powerful players in post war Libya  filling a void left by weak police and a shattered army Successive governments have put militias on their payroll in return for maintaining order  but rivalries over control and resources have led to fierce fighting among them and posed a constant challenge to the central government and a hoped for transition to democracy On Sunday  the Libyan government announced that they had lost control of the capital Ansar al Sharia has ties to the Islamic State  also known as ISIS  the Syrian group which today released the filmed beheading of American journalist Steven Sotloff   the second recorded execution of a U S  hostage by the group Fighters from Al Qaeda affiliated group Libyan Dawn pose on top of a heavily armoured truck as Tripoli Airport burns in the background following fighting there last month

Fears  Nearly a dozen commercial planes are missing in Libya after a radical Islamic group overtook the international airport in the capital of Tripoli late last month Aftermath  Tripoli International Airport was overtaken by the group Libyan Dawn last month and now 11 aircraft for Libyan Airlines and Afriqiyah Airways are missing

Moroccan military expert Abderrahmane Mekkaoui told Al Jazeera television after the airport attack that the planes had been taken by another Islamic group  the Masked Men Brigade Mekkaoui said there is  credible intelligence  that the Masked Men Brigade  is plotting to use the planes in attacks on the Maghreb state  on the 9 11 anniversary Sebastian Gorka  a counterterrorism expert  told the Free Beacon that the planes could be used in two ways to strike North Africa or even as far as the oil fields of Saudi Arabia  The first would be how commercial airliners were used on Sept 11  2001  literally turning an innocent mode of mass transit into a super high precision guided missile of immense potency  Gorka  the Maj Gen Charles Horner chair at the Marine Corps University  said Strike again A Moroccan military expert believes Islamic group The Masked Men Brigade are in control of the 11 missing airplanes

 The second tactic could be to use the airframe with its civilian markings as a tool of deception to insert a full payload of armed terrorists into a locale that otherwise is always open to commercial carriers  he added U S  officials have not publicly confirmed the eleven planes  disappearance  but are reportedly working to track them down Since the overthrow of previous dictator Muammar Gaddafi  Libya has descended into turmoil and officials fear it may become another safe haven for terrorists  like Syria Egypt s military government is currently looking into intervening in the country to restore order The U S  is taking a more conservative role in the country  but Secretary of State John Kerry said last week that he would be delivering Apache attack helicopters to Egypt ",0,34

"Cold Turkey There it was in the middle of a field  baking in the sun  a cache of grenades  rockets and guns The trove was attached to a big black parachute and  as the camera focused in on the shipment  it seemed for a moment abandoned Then you see the masked man  who sermonized for the occasion An American airdrop of arms  he said  which had been intended for Kurdish fighters defending the city of Kobane  had fallen into the hands of the Islamic State “These are some of the American aid  items  that were dropped for the atheists in the” Kurdistan Workers’ Party ” the militant said in a video uploaded to jihadist social media accounts and initially reported by SITE Intelligence Group “Ammunition  military equipment  additional equipment — these are some of the military weapons The American forces dropped  them  … Praise be to Allah Spoils for the mujahideen ”

News of the accidental airdrop  which the Associated Press corroborated and the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights confirmed  brought fresh criticism to a military tactic — the air drop — officials said has become substantially more accurate in the past few decades  but is still evidently prone to screw ups And those screw ups have popped up several times so far in the battle against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria  underscoring the dangers of trusting the winds to carry valuable resources to their targets In early August  the U S  military dropped more than 7 000 gallons of water and 36 000 packaged meals onto a barren mountain near Sinjar  the hiding spot for nearly 40 000 Yazidis who fled the Islamic State under threat of genocide Many packages reached their intended targets — the Department of Defense estimated 80 percent — but not all of them did “Iraqi officials said that much of the U S  aid had been ‘useless’ because it was dropped from 15 000 feet without parachutes and exploded on impact ” wrote journalist Jonathan Krohn  who claimed to be the first Western journalist on the scene The Washington Post’s Liz Sly agreed  saying the drops “apparently went awry ”

Then NBC News reported late last month Iraqi military pilots accidentally dropped food  water and weapons to Islamic State fighters instead of to their own soldiers  who were battling to retain control of Anbar province “Some pilots  instead of dropping these supplies over the area of the Iraqi army  threw it over an area that is controlled by ISIS fighters ” Hakim al Zamili said  using another name for the Islamic State “Those soldiers were in deadly need of these supplies  but because of the wrong plans of the commanders in the Iraqi army and lack of experience of the pilots  we in a way or another helped ISIS fighters to kill our soldiers ”

Another general sheepishly added  “Yes  that’s what had happened ”

The embarrassing anecdotes feed into the complicated history of the airdrop  which still carries risks despite being honed over decades with technological advancements such as GPS guided parachutes “There’s no way you can predict who may end up with those weapons  and who is going to use them  or how they are going to use them ” Greg Myre of the Middle East Institute told the Daily Sabah “That is one of the risks you have to take ”

It was a risk Bill Clinton was willing to take in 1993 That was the year he ordered an airdrop of tens of thousands of humanitarian packages over eastern Bosnia  despite the “military consistently arguing against involving U S  troops in airdrops in hostile zones  given the fact that the accuracy of the drops is questionable ” the Associated Press then reported The brass turned out to be right One major problem laid bare during that mission  military scientists later said  was what they called “wind drift ” “The problem was identified in the late ’90s ” John McGinley  a scientist who researched the topic  told The Washington Post’s Holly Watt in 2008 “The terrain in Bosnia meant that instead of landing in one valley  the cargo could drift into another valley that was held by the enemy Wind drift was causing all the problems ”

So research teams got to work  ultimately unveiling wind forecast software that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said increased the drop’s accuracy by 70 percent “Inaccurate wind forecasts are the main culprit in missed targets for dropping supplies and other items from high altitudes ” the report said It almost immediately went into use in the war in Afghanistan  where far flung military outposts were separated by stretches of roads pockmarked with insurgents and explosives There had to be another way to get soldiers the equipment they needed  military officials thought  so they launched a massive increase in airdrops “We’ve gotten a lot more accurate over the years ” Air Force Gen  Arthur Lichte told USA Today That may true But following this week’s alleged delivery to the Islamic State  there’s clearly still room for work ",0,36

"Matt Taibbi on leave of absence from First Look Media Matt Taibbi is taking a “leave of absence” from Pierre Omidyar’s First Look Media  according to New York Magazine The move comes “after disagreements with higher ups inside Omidyar’s organization  a source close to First Look confirmed today ”

Over the last year  however  the center of gravity of the organization has shifted  as Omidyar and his Silicon Valley braintrust have exerted control over budgets and vacillated over the journalistic mission Over the summer  Omidyar appointed a longtime confidante  John Temple — a former newspaper editor who previously led an Omidyar financed civic journalism venture in Hawaii — to be the president for audience and products  putting him in a position above Eric Bates  the former Rolling Stone editor who was brought on as a First Look editorial director  who is close to Taibbi The “leave of absence” also comes three months after I first reported that Omidyar had apparently ordered Taibbi to change his strategy away from purely covering corporate fatcats  like  uh  Pierre Omidyar  to a wider mission  involving more comedy than reporting Around the same time I heard rumors that Eric Bates was also unhappy at the organization I’ve previously had a… uh… spirited email conversation with Taibbi about both claims  although Taibbi would only engage on the condition that his words were “not for publication” — a strange demand coming from an editor at a site that’s about leaking confidential documents I emailed Taibbi again today to ask if I can publish his responses in the light of today’s news He replied  “No  you may not ”

Here then  for what little it’s worth  is my side of the correspondence  from back in July  in which I laid out the state of First Look as I saw it  with a little help from some well placed sources The discussion was… uh… spirited on both sides All words below are mine — you’ll just have to try to infer what Taibbi’s stated position might have been A note on not for publication   off the record  I thought carefully about the ethics of publishing even my half of a “not for publication” conversation Given First Look’s own policy of publishing confidential documents and the fact that it seems clear Taibbi wasn’t being entirely truthful about his place at the company  I ultimately came down on the side of publishing my own responses  with Taibbi’s words redacted I’m sure some readers with disagree — I welcome the discussion Also  an important disclosure  Taibbi previously worked with Pando’s Mark Ames on Russian ex pat newspaper  the Exile It has been widely reported that the two are no longer on speaking terms I didn’t discuss this post with Mark before publishing Ok  here are the emails…

 The email thread began with Taibbi s emailing me to deny that Omidyar had changed his strategy I had emailed First Look for comment on my story before publication but received no reply Taibbi s email was headed  Not for publication From  Paul Carr To  Matt Taibbi Date  Tue  Jul 29  2014  Redacted Taibbi quote  denying my story  Right  but that’s not the part that seems to have changed What’s changed is that Omidyar’s description of the site yesterday made zero mention of wall street It’s gone from finance first to politics first More broadly  and happy to stay off the record  there’s clearly something weird going on over there Why does a 250m journalism project have to shift focus before it’s launched It suggests PO has no clue how to handle talent and so is retreating back to technology  Taibbi responded  with questions of his own Here s my reply 

From  Paul Carr To  Matt Taibbi Date  Tue  Jul 29  2014 I don’t think  Omidyar  took you aside and ordered you not to cover his friends I think either you made the decision yourself for reasons of an easier life  or his blog post was the first you heard about the change and he just publicly fucked you over Knowing what I do about his management style I’m leaning towards the latter But I emailed you because I actually want to understand what’s going on  Taibbi responded again And I replied again 

From  Paul Carr To  Matt Taibbi Date  Tue  Jul 29  2014  Redacted If I waited for Pierre and his staffers to respond to questions I’d never publish a thing about First Look I’ve given PO 48hrs to respond before  and still got nothing I’m sure you’ve always held stories indefinitely until you receive a response As for your bizarre chain of straw man arguments — I didn’t say he’d hired you to shut you up So  no  I don’t  believe  something you just made up As you say  that would be real  redacted  analysis Here’s what I believe… I don’t think Pierre has any idea why he hired you  and I don’t think you’re entirely sure either Perhaps he was looking for names that looked good on a press release and you fit the bill I think you’re tired  and I think you knew the Rolling Stone gig wasn’t going to last for ever I think PO offered you complete editorial freedom and promised you a blank check to build your own team For that reason  I think Omidyar’s announcement yesterday should be terrifying to you  and to anyone else who works at FLM He’s lost his nerve — for a combination of reasons — and is retreating to something he understands  Technology and platforms I’ve spoken to people who have known Omidyar for decades and people who have worked with him on previous publications — if you seriously think he’s going to have your back when you go after his pals you’re more naive than… well  than you are I’m tired of this conversation now I honestly can’t tell if you’re being a team player  or if you believe any of this crap I’m sure I’ll continue to cover FLM and I’ll continue to ask for comment when I do It’s entirely up to you if you respond before publication or wait until afterwards and then bitch on Twitter Either way  I’ll continue to read your Wall St stuff if when you publish it — just as I read  and enjoyed  your most recent book on a long flight a few weeks back Best of luck  Paul

 Taibbi responded again From  Paul Carr To  Matt Taibbi Date  Wed  Jul 30  2014 I’m tired of it because you refuse to actually engage in conversation I’ve laid out my position  clearly and honestly  and asked follow up questions You won’t actually address any of my points — you just keep lobbing back straw men and not engaging with what I’m saying At the very least you’ve turned into a corporate flack for First Look  Continuing to hammer away at a caricatured version of what I said  while refusing to answer questions  and demanding that the whole thing stay off the record so that readers continue to be left in the dark The last person who tried that line of attack over a Pando story was Lanny Davis  Redacted  I’ve told you what I believe  but I’ll humor you — and your enjoyment at playing PR flack — by saying it again  this time line by line…  Redacted Taibbi quote  I think it’s unlikely Pierre  ordered  you to stop writing about Wall Street I’d say the odds  are  almost zero He’s not that fucking stupid Here’s what I said “No  of course I don’t think he took you aside and ordered you not to cover his friends I think either you made the decision yourself for reasons of an easier life  or his blog post was the first you heard about the change and he just publicly fucked you over ” Here’s my question  which you don’t seem keen to answer  Did you know Pierre was going to leave finance out of his post about what your editorial mission would be If not  doesn’t that worry you If so  what is the reasoning behind not mentioning the thing that you are best known for but which is likely to make your sole funder and boss the most uncomfortable A follow up question  What are we to make of the fact that First Look journalists — Greenwald in particular — insist that Pierre has no control over editorial  indeed you’ve insisted similar in this conversation  and yet he’s the one laying out the company’s editorial plan Why wouldn’t that be the job of the actual editors Instead we have your  250m funder issuing a statement that marginalizes the one aspect of your work that might sting him while reassuring the world that — don’t worry — he intends to permit you and Greenwald to continue doing your jobs  but that he has decided to axe plans for all the other editorial sites he previously  in a video starring him  said he would fund What does the phrase “editorial independence” actually mean at First Look  Redacted Taibbi quote  I think that’s what he told you when you were first hired  yes People are told lots of things on first dates  Redacted Taibbi quote  I’ve never said otherwise That’s a total red herring  Redacted Taibbi quote   Redacted  I didn’t mention anything in my story about Pierre ordering you to stop writing  because  as I’ve made clear  I don’t believe that would make any sense  I didn’t mention what I suspect you might have been told when you were hired  because  again  I don’t know What I know — and what I wrote — is that the public statements about your mission have changed  I didn’t mention it being a satirical publication because that hasn’t changed  Redacted Taibbi quote  A press release about what your job and focus will be  written by the man who writes your pay checks and who is backing down on almost all of the editorial strategy that was in place when you were hired A press release that was at odds with all previous statements about what your focus will be  specifically leaving out the one thing that would seem to have the potential to make Omidyar most concerned Yes  I believe that means you will be focussing far less on that aspect of things and  yes  I believe that it’s either a choice you’ve consciously made  or a choice Pierre is attempting to make for you through passive aggressive public messaging Your choice of denial is interesting “ Redacted ” That’s the same line Greenwald used when he was challenged on whether he would write about Pierre’s business interests Clear enough to sound like a denial  but general enough to allow you to focus most of your energies away from Wall Street Do you at least concede that previously the chief focus of your site was to be on finance and now it’s on politics and “culture” If the  main focus  of the site still on uncovering financial corruption Yes or no If yes  why did your boss mischaracterize the site so badly in his blog post  and if no  why not  Redacted Taibbi quote  Pierre has been interfering with First Look’s editorial plans from the start Every single editorial plan First Look has exists only at Pierre’s pleasure He is your sole funder and he is the one making public statements about how he intends to allocate those resources How is it possible you understand Wall Street so well but don’t understand that  Redacted Taibbi quote  Yes  that is what’s apparent from Omidyar’s statement  Redacted Taibbi quote  I had plenty of information  and printed what I knew  after giving you the opportunity to respond before publication I’d have plenty more information to set the record straight if you’d answer any of the questions above Or better still  stop hiding behind “not for publication ” Why  if you’re being so unfairly maligned  won’t you let any of the above be shared with readers Isn’t the whole basis of First Look to make all the information public and let readers decide Why doesn’t that apply to conversations about First Look and its billionaire owner Which leads me to my last question  Have you  or any first look staffer to the best of your knowledge  signed an NDA or non disparagement contract — either as a standalone or as part of your employment contract s You’re right  this is an enjoyable conversation Now let’s shift it up a gear and get to some real answers Paul

Despite previously saying he was enjoying our conversation  Taibbi stopped responding when I asked him he had signed any kind of contract restricting his freedom to talk openly about First Look When I emailed him earlier today  I asked if he had anything to add to his previous comments He replied  “Just that your story was wrong then and still is ”",0,40
"Managua explosion not a meteorite  NASA suggests Nicaraguan officials say a meteorite gouged out a crater near the nation s capital city over the weekend  but scientists aren t so sure A committee formed by the Nicaraguan government determined that a new  39 foot wide  12 meters  crater found near the capital Managua s international airport was blasted out by a space rock strike Saturday night  Sept  6  the Associated Press reported Some Managua residents reported hearing a loud boom on Saturday  which would be consistent with a meteorite impact But other details warrant a healthy dose of skepticism  said Bill Cooke  head of the Meteoroid Environment Office at NASA s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville  Alabama  Nicaraguan Crater Possibly Caused by Meteorite  Video 
 Something that produced a crater this big should have also produced an incredibly bright fireball in the night sky  Cooke said  And no one reports a fireball  even though it was near midnight under scattered clouds Further  Managua is a big city  with lots of potential witnesses to such a night sky sight People saw a bright fireball the last time Cooke can recall a meteorite blasting out a crater on Earth  in September 2007 near the Peruvian village of Carancas — and that impact occurred in broad daylight A meteorite strike would also likely leave blackened fragments of the impacting body behind as evidence  both Cooke and meteor expert Peter Jenniskens said  If this crater has anything to do with a meteoroid impact  I would expect meteorites to be found in and around the crater  Jenniskens  of the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence  SETI  Institute in Mountain View  California  told Space com via email No such pieces have been reported  and none are visible in photos of the crater  Cooke said  So I m kind of skeptical of a meteoritic origin for this crater  he said If a space rock did indeed carve out the Nicaraguan crater  the meteorite was likely relatively small — about 3 feet  1 m  wide if made of iron  and somewhat larger if composed of rocky material  Cooke added Some Nicaraguan officials have speculated that the purported meteorite may be a piece of the asteroid 2014 RC  which flew by Earth on Sunday  Sept  7  the AP reported But that is not the case  experts said  For those wondering  the event in Nicaragua  poss meteorite is unrelated to asteroid 2014 RC Different timing  different directions  NASA officials wrote today  Sept  8  via the  AsteroidWatchTwitter account  which is run by the space agency s Near Earth Object Office at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena  California ",0,41

"The baby from Teletubbies reveals herself As a chuckling baby  Jess Smith was one of the most familiar faces on British television in the 1990s As the BBC prepares to make 60 new episodes of the hugely popular Teletubbies  the laughing tot in the sun – who featured in all 365 programmes – is now 19 and a university student At the age of nine months  Jess Smith was selected to be the giggling Baby Sun who looks over Teletubbyland The news will come as no surprise to people who have known Jess for a long time  but she said it is not something she really talked about as she was quite a shy child and “everyone knowing would have been a bit scary” The former Chatham South and Horsted Primary School pupil made the decision to tell people during her first week at university  when they all had to say something about themselves that no one else would guess Jess Smith  from Chatham  now aged 19
She said  “I thought I may as well tell them as I’m going to be spending the next three years with them ”

Jess  a first year dance education student at Canterbury Christ Church University  then broke the news on Facebook She wrote  “So I’ve recently celebrated my 19th birthday and after a lot of thought  I’ve decided it’s time to tell everyone I used to hide it but after a lot of encouragement from my friends at university  I’ve gained the confidence to come out with it “I am the sun from Teletubbies There has been quite a few people pretending to be ‘the sun’ but only I could tell you the real story ”

In 1996  her mother  Anji Smith  took her to Edenbridge Hospital to be weighed and a health visitor  who had been asked by Ragdoll Productions to find smiley babies  put Jess’s name forward Mrs Smith said it was never intended to be a big thing  “It was just something a bit different to do and we didn’t expect it to be as big as it was “They just sat her in front of a camera and she just laughed and smiled at her dad We didn’t hear anything until we got a letter when she was 18 months old saying she’d been picked It was really weird seeing her on television ”

And as no one could predict the success of the show  Jess was paid just £250 for filming and given a box of toys to take home ",0,48

"Islamic State  in video titled  A Message to America  beheads American journalist James Wright Foley who was kidnapped in 2012 President Obama said Wednesday that the United States “will be vigilant and we will be relentless” against Islamic State militants and would “do what’s necessary to see that justice is done” following the videotaped execution of an American journalist “Today the entire world is appalled at the brutal murder of James Foley by the terrorist group ISIL ” Obama said  using one of several acronyms for the group The militants  who posted the video on YouTube Tuesday  said Foley’s killing was in retaliation for U S  airstrikes in Iraq Obama  who spoke Wednesday morning to Foley’s parents  offered no new policy measures to confront Islamic State Referring to neighboring countries and U S  allies  he said “there has to be a common effort to extract this cancer so that it does not spread ”

Asked whether the United States might consider suspending its airstrikes  one U S  official said the “only question is if we do more ” Officials said that attacks against the Islamic State would continue in Iraq under an authorization Obama signed early this month Obama could face pressure to escalate the air campaign in Iraq and increase support to U S backed rebels in Syria who are fighting against the Islamic Front  as well as Syrian President Bashar al Assad Obama has resisted pleas from the Syrian rebels for U S  heavy weapons  including portable surface to air missiles  as well as for American air support In a statement issued after the president’s remarks  Rep  Ed Royce  R Calif  chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee  said  “We must get serious about confronting this force  including by aggressively arming those battling it ”

The White House confirmed early Wednesday that U S  intelligence had deemed the video authentic Obama spoke in Martha’s Vineyard  where he is vacationing with his family Foley  a 40 year old New Hampshire native and a photojournalist working for the Boston based Web site Global­Post  was kidnapped in northern Syria nearly two years ago while covering the civil war in Syria In Britain Wednesday  Prime Minister David Cameron cut short a family vacation and returned to London to chair emergency meetings on Iraq and Syria  amid indications that a British citizen was involved in Foley’s killing In the video  his masked executioner speaks in English with what sounds like a British accent After beheading Foley  the executioner is pictured with a second captive  identified as U S  freelance journalist Steven Joel Sotloff  who disappeared last year in Syria “The life of this American citizen  Obama  depends on your next decision ” the executioner says In an interview with the BBC  British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond acknowledged that the executioner spoke with a British accent and said the video seemed to be genuine Hundreds of Britons are believed to have traveled to Syria to fight in the country’s civil war  including many who have joined the Islamic State “We’re absolutely aware that there are significant numbers of British nationals involved in terrible crimes  probably in the commission of atrocities ” Hammond said “Many of these people may seek at some point to return to the U K  and they would then pose a direct threat to our domestic security ”

A European intelligence official said the British government was examining the video  and the speech of the purported executioner  to compare it to the speech of former Guantanamo Bay prisoners and other British residents believed to have joined the Islamic State Both prisoners in the video are wearing orange shirts and pants  similar to orange jumpsuits worn by detainees at the U S  military prison at Guantanamo Bay  Cuba A similar outfit  believed to be a jihadist symbol of the prison  was worn by Nicholas Berg  an American businessman kidnapped in Iraq in 2004 whose execution by an Islamic State precursor organization was recorded on video and posted online Foley  40  was working in Syria for the Boston based news Web site Global­Post when he disappeared on Thanksgiving in 2012 In a statement Tuesday night on a Facebook page dedicated to his freedom  Foley’s mother wrote  “We have never been prouder of our son Jim ” Diane Foley wrote “He gave his life trying to expose the world to the suffering of the Syrian people “We implore the kidnappers to spare the lives of the remaining hostages Like Jim  they are innocents They have no control over American government policy in Iraq  Syria or anywhere in the world ”

Praising James Foley as “an extraordinary son  brother  journalist and person ” she asked that the family’s privacy be respected In addition to Foley and Sotloff  at least three other Americans are believed to be captives in Syria  according to a 2013 Global­Post article  including Austin Tice  a freelance journalist whose articles appeared in McClatchy publications and The Washington Post before his disappearance in August 2012 No one has claimed to be holding them According to the Committee to Protect Journalists  at least 66 journalists  all but 10 of them Syrian  have been killed covering the Syrian war If the video is authenticated  Foley would be the first American journalist known to be executed since the conflict began in early 2011 The video evoked the 2002 taped execution in Pakistan of Wall Street Journal correspondent Daniel Pearl by al Qaeda The Islamic State  an offshoot of al Qaeda  is the most powerful among a number of extremist organizations that have emerged during the Syrian civil war  which began as a popular uprising against President Bashar al Assad Fighting against both Assad and U S backed rebels  the militants now control much of eastern Syria and claim to have established an Islamic caliphate spanning Syria and neighboring Iraq As the group has grown  it has merged with the group formerly known as al Qaeda in Iraq  under the leadership of Abu Bakr al Baghdadi According to U S  intelligence  it numbers in the thousands  including foreign fighters from Europe and the United States In April  Islamic State fighters swept across the border into northern Iraq  taking over the city of Mosul before moving southward to within 60 miles of Baghdad Extensive reports of executions  including beheadings and crucifixions  have emerged from areas under the group’s control This month  amid reports of stranded and besieged Iraqi minorities threatened with execution  the militants advanced eastward toward Irbil  the capital of the semiautonomous Kurdish region of Iraq On Aug  7  Obama authorized U S  airstrikes to rescue stranded minorities and protect U S  personnel and facilities in Irbil and Baghdad On Monday  after a total of 68 strikes from jets  bombers and drones  Obama announced that Iraqi and Kurdish forces  with U S  air support  had retaken a strategic dam north of Mosul from the militants and that they had been pushed back from Irbil Within hours of that announcement  the Islamic State posted an online message warning it would attack Americans “in any place” in response to the airstrikes “We will drown all of you in blood ” it said The title of the video posted Tuesday was “A Message to America” and was produced by the Islamic State’s media arm  according to the Site Intelligence Group  which monitors extremist Web sites A masked man dressed in black is shown standing in an unidentified desert location beside a prisoner kneeling beside him with his hands behind his back “Obama authorized military operations against the Islamic State effectively placing America upon a slippery slope towards a new war against Muslims ” the masked man says The video then shows a clip of Obama’s Aug  7 announcement  followed by a statement from the prisoner “I call on my friends  family and loved ones to rise up against my real killers  the U S  government  for what will happen to me is only a result of their complacent criminality ” he says He asks his parents not to accept “any meager compensation from the same people who effectively hit the last nail in my coffin with the recent aerial campaign in Iraq ”

The prisoner also appeals to “my brother John  who is a member of the U S  Air Force ” to “think about what you are doing ”

“I wish I had more time ” he says “I wish I could have the hope for freedom to see my family once again  but that ship has sailed I guess all in all  I wish I wasn’t an American ”

The masked man then identifies the prisoner as “James Wright Foley  an American citizen of your country ” He then reaches down with a large knife and begins the apparent beheading of the prisoner  the screen fades to black and the next image is of a body with a head placed upon its back The masked man then appears with another prisoner  identified as Sotloff  in a similar kneeling position Foley reported from some of the most dangerous recent crises and was imprisoned for 44 days in Libya in 2011 by forces loyal to deposed leader Moammar Gaddafi According to Global­Post  two eyewitnesses saw his interception by a group of armed men in a silver colored van on a road near the town of Taftanaz in northern Syria on Nov  22  2012 Since then  Global­Post “has mounted an extensive international investigation    to determine who kidnapped Foley and where he was being held ” Global­Post said in an article on its Web site late Tuesday Julie Tate and Dan Lamothe in Washington  Griff Witte in London and Souad Mekhennet in Frankfurt  Germany  contributed to this report ",0,51

"Explosion reported near the Nicaraguan capital attributed to meteorite impact  but experts  including NASA  cast doubt on claims  Update  The story has been updated to reflect new evidence and analysis from experts News has been circulating about a potential meteorite strike near Managua  Nicaragua late Saturday night  just 13 hours or so before the close flyby of 20 m asteroid 2014 RC  leading some to suggest that the two events are related However  according to experts who have been examining the evidence  including those at NASA  the two events are completely unrelated  and the explosion in Managua may have nothing to do with objects falling from space According to the Nicaraguan news site el19digital com  an explosion occurred around 11 05 p m  Saturday night  in the city of Managua  which apparently produced a crater that was over 12 metres  39 feet  wide and about 1 5 metres  5 feet  deep  in a wooded area just to the west of the city s international airport  and just south of the Pan American Highway The video below  from RT com  shows military personnel investigating the crater  as well as the surrounding area  for potential debris from the explosion While the incident is still being investigated  officials with Nicaragua s Institute of Territorial Studies  INET  which monitors earthquake activity in the country  said that the event showed up on the agency s seismic instruments  We are convinced that this was a meteorite We have seen the crater from the impact  Wilfried Strauch from INET said in a press conference  according to Agence France Presse  AFP  You can see two waves  first  a small seismic wave when the meteorite hit earth  and then another stronger one  which is the impact of the sound However  while there have been reports of people hearing the explosion  the scientists have the seismic data from it  and they have the resulting crater  there are parts of the story that just don t add up A 20 metre wide asteroid named 2014 RC passed by Earth on Sunday  flying underneath the planet  from the perspective of someone in the northern hemisphere  and while there is roughly a 13 hour difference in the timing of these two events  some saw a potential connection between these events It s not entirely unreasonable to suggest this There are over 11 000 known near Earth asteroids flying around the Sun  and very likely millions that we haven t detected  and likely won t  because they re too small While most of these follow their own path as they circle the Sun  not all are alone Some asteroids have tiny moons orbiting them Some are best described as  rubble piles  which are groups of smaller objects only barely held together into a boulder like shape by their mutual gravity Others can be travelling along in  packs  with some members preceding or lagging behind the  pack leader    possibly due to an impact with another meteoroid or asteroid at some point So  if one of these asteroid  packs  is flying by  or an asteroid that still has debris from a past impact travelling along the same orbit  it is possible that one piece could strike the atmosphere and survive to hit the ground However  just because two events   an asteroid flyby and a meteorite impact   happen close to one another  doesn t mean that they are related We saw this back in mid February 2013  when we were watching asteroid 2012 DA14 sweep by Earth and suddenly a 20 m wide asteroid exploded over Chelyabinsk  Russia The exact timing and traced orbits of these two objects quickly showed that they were completely separate objects and the timing was a just coincidence According to NASA s Jet Propulsion Laboratory Near Earth Object Office  that appears to be the case for this event 
A meteorite without the meteor An interesting fact about this supposed  impact  is that  although the explosion was heard throughout the area  apparently nobody witnessed any bright light associated with it When a meteoroid enters the atmosphere  even if it is just a speck of dust  it is traveling so fast  typically around 17 kilometres per second or over 60 000 km h  that it heats up the air in front of it  causing the air to glow brightly and produce the streak of light in the sky we call a meteor Larger objects cause even brighter flashes  earning them the name fireball or even bolide  for an exceptionally large and bright one Some of these are so bright that they can  very briefly  turn night into day as they pass overhead Given the weather over Managua on Saturday night  scattered clouds and calm winds  it would have been very difficult to miss such a fireball or bolide lighting up their night sky  especially when it happened near a city of over 2 million people According to the Associated Press  Strauch said it was  very strange that no one reported a streak of light We have to ask if anyone has a photo or something Was it something else This lack of a fireball is a sticking point in the story While nearly all meteorites go through a  dark flight  phase during the final part of their journey to Earth s surface   after it has slowed down enough that it isn t compressing the air enough to cause it to glow   their fireball or bolide stage happens far up in the atmosphere  some 20 to 30 kilometres above the ground  making them visible far and wide across the countryside Geoff Nodkin  professional meteorite hunter and host of Science Channel s Meteorite Men  tweeted his thoughts about the possibility of this being authentic 
Notkin further commented that if it was meteorite related  he would expect there to be a very bright fireball  sonic booms during the object s dark flight and then the impact He also said that  to produce a crater like the one seen  it would have to be an iron meteorite  as they are the densest and  have formed the majority of known meteorite craters on Earth 

In an interview with National Geographic  Donald Yeomans  the author of Near Earth Objects  Finding Them Before They Find Us  said   There was no obvious optical fireball or debris trail seen prior to the explosion  so it seems unlikely that the explosion in Nicaragua was related to a meteorite impact So  what was this  if it wasn t a meteorite One very real possibility is that it was a landmine explosion  as there are still thousandsIn cas buried throughout the country  remnants of the war fought there in the 1980s While this particular event is looking more and more like a false alarm with time  it should be noted that fireballs blaze through our skies every day  as tons of material is swept up by Earth as the planet orbits the Sun Many of these are missed because they occur during the day  or over regions of the planet that aren t heavily populated Some countries have all sky camera networks to capture these events  with data being reported on sites like SpaceWeather com  U S  and the University of Western Ontario  Canada As an example  there was a bright fireball that occurred just before this explosion in Managua  but it happened thousands of kilometres away across the Atlantic Ocean  over eastern Spain  as shown in this animation taken from railway camera video  note what appears to be a second object that may be a piece breaking off the primary one ",0,54

" American bombing had signed my death certificate  Missing US journalist James Wright Foley goes unflinching to his death as ISIS behead him in horrific video  as a warning to Obama President Barack Obama denounced Islamic State  Isis  militants for murdering an American journalist in retaliation for US air strikes in Iraq  showing an anger he has rarely displayed in remarks about the Iraq conflict “No just god would stand for what they did yesterday and every single day ” Obama said Wednesday in brief remarks from Edgerton  Massachusetts  where he is vacationing Hours after US intelligence authenticated a gruesome Isis videotape showing the execution of captive journalist James Foley  an act committed with the goal of deterring future US strikes on Isis  Obama said that Isis “has no place in the 21st century ” and called on allies to help defeat a “cancer so it does not spread ”

Obama did not announce any intensification of his bombing campaign  now in its thirteenth day US Central Command has yet to announce any new strikes since the Tuesday appearance of the social media borne Foley video  although sporadic reports from Iraq have indicated some may have taken place Wednesday An emotional Obama ran through a litany of Isis human rights abuses  from rape to enslavement  calling them “cowardly acts of violence ” In a vague reference to Americans held captive by Isis or near its path in Iraq  Obama said the US would “do everything we can to protect our people ” a formulation that has preceded US military action in the past With the death of the first American in Iraq since the US military withdrew in 2011  pressure is mounting on Obama to expand his already growing and amorphous air war against Isis The stated purpose of nearly two weeks of bombing has moved from the rescue of mostly Yazidi Iraqi civilians at risk of genocide to providing air cover for Kurdish and Iraqi forces wresting the strategically vital Mosul Dam away from Isis Aides to Obama pointed out from the start that threats to critical infrastructure would likely prompt a US reprisal Buffeted between calls to destroy Isis and criticism of their shifting rationale  Obama and the Pentagon have strenuously objected to a charge of mission creep They point out the consistency of the goals Obama has articulated since 8 August  preventing humanitarian catastrophe and protecting US personnel in Iraq Yet both are broad enough to encompass aerial protection of Iraqi Kurdistan and the destruction of Isis vehicles  artillery and fixed positions from Mount Sinjar to the Mosul Dam The murder of Foley – delivered after he gave a statement at knifepoint blaming the US for his death – and Isis’s threat to kill another American journalist  Steven Sotloff  is also testing Obama’s goal of safeguarding US nationals in a country overrun by Isis National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said Wednesday that the video showed both Foley and Sotloff Leaders from the UK  France and other countries lined up to excoriate Isis for the slaying British prime minister David Cameron called it “shocking” and cut short his summer holiday to chair meetings on a response A particularly acute concern for the UK government is the British accent heard from Foley’s masked killer US intelligence believes hundreds of westerners  including Americans  have joined Isis In the UK  Scotland Yard’s counter terrorism command  SO15  launched an investigation into the video as leading linguistics experts said the man sounded like he was from London or the south east of England The British foreign secretary  Philip Hammond  said of the video  “All the hallmarks point to it being genuine We’re very concerned by the apparent fact that the murderer in question is British and we are urgently investigating – agencies on both sides of the Atlantic – are first of all looking to authenticate the video  to make sure that it is genuine  and sadly it appears to be  and then to see if we can identify the individual in question ”

A spokesman for German chancellor Angela Merkel called Foley’s murder barbaric Laurent Fabius  the French foreign minister  said it exposed Isis as the “caliphate of barbarism” French president Francois Hollande told Le Monde that a global effort “beyond the traditional debate of intervention or non intervention” was necessary to confront Isis  and proposed an international meeting next month With a brutality so severe it prompted al Qaida to divorce it from the terrorist franchise  Isis has fulfilled a jihadist aspiration to carve out a state It flies a flag  sets up internal police to govern its subjects’ adherence to its interpretation of Islamic laws and customs  and maintains financial viability through the control of seized oil assets While other jihadist entities employ terrorist and insurgent tactics  for which infiltration of another’s populace is central  Isis has mustered a highly mobile army that seizes and holds territory Foley’s killer emphasized in a propaganda video that Isis is a state  not a terrorist group  a distinction that is fundamental to the group’s prestige On Wednesday  Obama repeatedly called Isis “terrorists ”

The Committee to Protect Journalists said the murder of Foley  40  who went missing during a reporting trip to Syria in 2012  “sickens all decent people” “Foley went to Syria to show the plight of the Syrian people  to bear witness to their fight  and in so doing to fight for press freedom ” Sandra Mims Rowe  the group’s chair  said in a statement In a Facebook message attributed to her  Foley’s mother Diane said  “We have never been prouder of our son Jim He gave his life trying to expose the world to the suffering of the Syrian people ” She also asked the media and the public to respect her family’s privacy Obama hailed Foley  who he called Jim  and said he had called Foley’s parents Foley’s murder  Obama said  was “an act of violence that shocks the conscience of the entire world ”",0,61

Paul Horner is the name given to a Facebook spokesperson who said the site will soon be charging users  2 99 a month – another hoax story that comes around every now and again – as well as the name from a hoax story about a 15 year old Louisiana teen who was sentenced to 25 years to life after he called a SWAT team to another teenager’s house after he beat him while playing Battlefield 4 The article is also said to have been written by Dr Darius Rubics  a fake name for a writer who claims to have be a Pulitzer prize winning reporter but who  unsurprisingly since his previous stories include ‘Obama Declares November National Muslim Appreciation Month’ and ‘Dennis Rodman Leaves US To Talk With Leaders Of Isis’  has never been awarded any prizes for excellence in journalism HAHA get it It’s funny because it’s not true I guess there’s some logic in there somewhere It’s not even entertaining to see people share stories that come from places like the The National Report since they’re designed to trick — unlike when dumb people share stories from The Onion  which are designed to actually be satire Again  and I cannot stress this enough  F ck those guys ",0,82

"Sorry  Fido Pope Francis did NOT say our pets are going to heaven 14 3K 3077reddit70  32

 RNS  When Pope Francis recently sought to comfort a distraught boy whose dog had died  the pontiff took the sort of pastoral approach he is famous for — telling the youngster not to worry  that he would one day see his pet in heaven “Paradise is open to all of God’s creatures ” Francis said reassuringly Pope Francis greets a crowd on his way to a meeting with cardinals at the Vatican on Feb  21  2014 RNS photo by David Gibson

 This image is available for Web and print publication For questions  contact Sally Morrow It was a sparkling moment on a rainy November day  and the setting in St  Peter’s Square only burnished Francis’ reputation as a kindly “people’s pope ” The story naturally lit up social media  became instant promotional material for vegetarians and animal rights groups  and on Friday even made it to the front page of The New York Times There’s only one problem  apparently none of it ever happened Yes  a version of that quotation was uttered by a pope  but it was said decades ago by Paul VI  who died in 1978 There is no evidence that Francis repeated the words during his public audience on Nov  26  as has been widely reported  nor was there was a boy mourning his dead dog So how could such a fable so quickly become taken as fact Part of the answer may be the topic of the pope’s talk to the crowd that day  which centered on the End Times and the transformation of all creation into a “new heaven” and a “new earth ” Citing St  Paul in the New Testament  Francis said that is not “the annihilation of the cosmos and of everything around us  but the bringing of all things into the fullness of being ”

The trail of digital bread crumbs then appears to lead to an Italian news report that extended Francis’ discussion of a renewed creation to the question of whether animals too will go to heaven “One day we will see our pets in the eternity of Christ ” the report quoted Paul VI as telling a disconsolate boy years ago The story was titled  somewhat misleadingly  “Paradise for animals The Pope doesn’t rule it out ” It wasn’t clear which pope the writer meant  however The next day  Nov  27  a story in the Italian daily Corriere della Sera by veteran Vaticanista Gian Guido Vecchi pushed the headline further  “The Pope and pets  “Paradise is open to all creatures ”

Vecchi faithfully recounted the pope’s talk about a new creation  and also cited Paul VI’s remark But the headline put those words in Francis’ mouth  and that became the story The Italian version of the Huffington Post picked it up next and ran an article quoting Francis as saying “We will go to heaven with the animals” and contending that the pope was quoting St  Paul – not Pope Paul – as making that statement to console a boy who lost his dog  That story  by the way  is nowhere in the Bible The urban legend became unstoppable a week later when it was translated into English and picked up by the British press  which cited St  Paul as saying that “One day we will see our animals again in  the  eternity of Christ ” while it has Francis adding the phrase  “Paradise is open to all God’s creatures ”

Fueling the meme was the fact that Francis was photographed accepting a gift of two donkeys from a company promoting the use of donkey milk for infants allergic to cow’s milk – and Francis said his own mother gave him donkey’s milk as a baby Social media and other media outlets then picked up the story  further conflating the statements and the chronology It became a hot mess of a story that was also sparking another theological debate by a pope who was known for prompting controversy The New York Times was the biggest of several outlets relating an apparently apocryphal tale about pets  paradise  and Pope Francis Show caption

The New York Times was the biggest of several outlets relating an apparently apocryphal tale about pets  paradise  and Pope Francis When The New York Times went with the story  along with input from ethicists and theologians  it became gospel truth Television programs discussed the pope’s theological breakthrough  news outlets created photo galleries of popes with cute animals  and others used it as a jumping off point to discuss what other religions think about animals and the afterlife At America magazine  the Rev James Martin wrote an essay discussing the theological implications of Francis’ statements and what level of authority they may have It was all very interesting and illuminating  but based on a misunderstanding A number of factors probably contributed to this journalistic train wreck 

The story had so much going for it  Francis took his papal name from St  Francis of Assisi  the patron saint of environmentalism who famously greeted animals as brothers and sisters Pope Francis is also preparing a major teaching document on the environment  and almost since the day he was elected in 2013 he has stressed the Christian duty to care for creation Francis also blessed a blind man’s guide dog shortly after he was elected  an affecting image that was often used in connection with these latest reports of his concern for animals Moreover  the media and the public are so primed for Francis to say novel things and disregard staid customs that the story was too good to check out  it fit with the pattern In most accounts  Francis’ comments were also set against statements by his predecessor  Benedict XVI  who insisted that animals did not have souls That apparent contrast fit a common narrative pitting the more conservative Benedict against the ostensibly liberal Francis That may be true in some areas  but probably not when it comes to animals Adding insult to injury  the Times article cited St  John Paul II as saying in 1990 that animals have souls and are “as near to God as men are ” But that  too  was a misquote  as media critic Dawn Eden explained at the website GetReligion On the other hand  there should have been warnings signs  Francis has frowned at the modern tendency to favor pets over people  and he has criticized the vast amounts of money spent by wealthy societies on animals even as children go hungry In addition  the pope’s huge popularity has led to at least one other instance of myth making  news reports last year said that Francis was sneaking out of the Vatican at night to feed the homeless around Rome The pope personally debunked that rumor in an interview last March  saying the idea “has never crossed my mind” and that “depicting the pope to be a sort of superman  a type of star  seems offensive to me ”

Maybe he’ll have to give another interview to deflate this latest story  and to offer his real thoughts on pets and paradise KRE END GIBSON",0,88

"ISIS Beheads Kidnapped Photojournalist James Wright Foley in Horrific Video Message to the U S In a horrifying act of revenge for U S  airstrikes in northern Iraq  militants with the Islamic State extremist group have beheaded American journalist James Foley — and are threatening to kill another hostage  U S  officials say The White House must now weigh the risks of adopting an aggressive policy to destroy the Islamic State against resisting any action that could result in the death of another American It will also confront the potentially necessary step of pursuing the Islamic State in Syria  where President Barack Obama has resisted launching airstrikes or deploying significant American firepower Obama was expected to make a statement Wednesday about Foley s killing U S  officials confirmed a grisly video released Tuesday showing Islamic State militants beheading Foley Separately  Foley s family confirmed his death in a statement posted on a Facebook page that was created to rally support for his release  saying they  have never been prouder of him  He gave his life trying to expose the world to the suffering of the Syrian people  said the statement  which was attributed to Foley s mother  Diane Foley She implored the militants to spare the lives of other hostages  Like Jim  they are innocents They have no control over American government policy in Iraq  Syria or anywhere in the world Foley  40  from Rochester  New Hampshire  went missing in northern Syria in November 2012 while freelancing for Agence France Presse and the Boston based media company GlobalPost The car he was riding in was stopped by four militants in a contested battle zone that both Sunni rebel fighters and government forces were trying to control He had not been heard from since The beheading marks the first time the Islamic State has killed an American citizen since the Syrian conflict broke out in March 2011  upping the stakes in an increasingly chaotic and multilayered war The killing is likely to complicate U S  involvement in Iraq and the Obama administration s efforts to contain the group as it expands in both Iraq and Syria The group is the heir apparent of the militancy known as al Qaida in Iraq  which beheaded many of its victims  including American businessman Nicholas Berg in 2004 The video released on websites Tuesday appears to show the increasing sophistication of the Islamic State group s media unit and begins with scenes of Obama explaining his decision to order airstrikes It then cuts to a balding man in an orange jumpsuit kneeling in the desert  next to a black clad militant with a knife to his throat Foley s name appears in both English and Arabic graphics on screen After the captive speaks  the masked man is shown apparently beginning to cut at his neck  the video fades to black before the beheading is completed The next shot appears to show the captive lying dead on the ground  his head on his body The video

recently threatened to kill Foley to avenge the crushing airstrikes over the past two weeks against militants advancing on Mount Sinjar  the Mosul dam and the Kurdish capital of Irbil Both areas are in northern Iraq  which has become a key front for the Islamic State as its fighters travel to and from Syria Since Aug  8  the U S  military has struck at least 70 Islamic State targets — including security checkpoints  vehicles and weapons caches It s not clear how many militants have been killed in the strikes  although it s likely that some were The Islamic State militant group is so ruthless in its attacks against all people they consider heretics or infidels that it has been disowned by al Qaida s leaders In seeking to impose its harsh interpretation of Islamic law in the lands it is trying to control  the extremists have slain soldiers and civilians alike in horrifying ways — including mounting the decapitated heads of some of its victims on spikes The New York based Committee to Protect Journalists estimated Tuesday that about 20 journalists are missing in Syria  and has not released their nationalities In its annual report in November  the committee concluded that the missing journalists were either being held and threatened with death by extremists  or taken captive by gangs seeking ransom The group s report described the widespread seizure of journalists as unprecedented and largely unreported by news organizations in the hope that keeping the kidnappings out of public view may help in the captives  release

"US confirms death of Somalia terror group leader WASHINGTON — The Pentagon on Friday confirmed the death of the leader of the al Shabab terror group  Ahmed Abdi Godane  who was the target of a U S  airstrike Monday in Somalia The Pentagon’s press secretary  Rear Adm  John Kirby  confirmed the death in a brief written statement President Barack Obama  speaking at the conclusion of a NATO summit in Newport  Wales  said the successful U S  strike was an example of his administration’s determination to hit back at terrorists Obama said the U S  would use the same approach in degrading the Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria “We have been very systematic and methodical in going after these kind of organizations” that threaten U S  personnel and the homeland  Obama said “That deliberation allows us to do it right  but have no doubt  We will continue to do what is necessary to protect the American people ”

The White House declared a counterterrorism success “Godane’s removal is a major symbolic and operational loss to the largest al Qaida affiliate in Africa and reflects years of painstaking work by our intelligence  military and law enforcement professionals ” a White House statement said “Even as this is an important step forward in the fight against al Shabab  the United States will continue to use the tools at our disposal – financial  diplomatic  intelligence and military – to address the threat that al Shabab and other terrorist groups pose to the United States and the American people ” It added U S  officials had said after the strike on Monday that U S  special operations forces using manned and drone aircraft had destroyed an encampment and a vehicle using several Hellfire missiles and laser guided munitions But they did not confirm that Godane had been killed until Friday The State Department declared al Shabab a terrorist organization in February 2008 Kirby said on Tuesday  before the Pentagon was certain that Godane had died  that the U S  strike was conducted south of Mogadishu and that it had destroyed the vehicle that was targeted He noted that in September 2013  Godone had publicly claimed al Shabab was responsible for the deadly Westgate Mall attack in Nairobi  Kenya “Under the leadership of Godane  al Shabab has claimed responsibility for many bombings  including suicide attacks in Mogadishu and in central and northern Somalia  typically targeting officials and perceived allies of the federal government of Somalia  as well as the former transitional federal government of Somali ” Kirby said Tuesday ",0,97

"ISIL Beheads American Photojournalist in Iraq New York  CNN    When war reporter James Foley wasn t writing for GlobalPost or recording video for AFP or appearing on the PBS  NewsHour  he occasionally shared stories on his own blog  aptly titled  A World of Troubles For a subtitle  he chose the famous Carl von Clausewitz sentence  War is fought by human beings And that is exactly what Foley sought to show with his reporting  humanity amid the horror of war Foley was abducted while on a reporting trip in northern Syria in November 2012 He was never heard from again A video published Tuesday by the extremist group ISIS showed Foley being beheaded It is not known when or where the video was recorded For Foley s family and friends  the recording was the answer they hoped they d never hear to their questions about his disappearance  We have never been prouder of our son Jim He gave his life trying to expose the world to the suffering of the Syrian people  his mother  Diane  said Tuesday night 

She called him  an extraordinary son  brother  journalist and person Courageous  generous

Foley was the oldest child of Diane and John Foley of Rochester  New Hampshire He had four siblings Foley   Jim to his friends   had been reporting from war torn countries for the better part of four years when he disappeared in Syria On Tuesday  fellow journalists remembered him for his courage and his generosity One of his friends  Alex Sherman of Bloomberg News  wrote on Twitter that he was a  funny  warm  Big Lebowski loving guy Another friend  Max Fisher of Vox  praised his  dedication to truth and understanding Fisher also wrote that  Jim s faith was something we all agreed not to discuss publicly while he was held in Syria  but it was the wellspring of his generosity 

He recalled how Foley helped to organize a memorial fund for a photographer  Anton Hammerl  who was killed in Libya in 2011 Foley had been traveling with Hammerl and two other journalists at the time  and the three who survived wound up in a Libyan jail Beheading of American journalist James Foley recalls past horrors

Front line journalist

Foley was freed six weeks later Afterward  in a video interview with the Boston Globe  he hesitated to make the story about himself  remarking at one point that  you don t want to be defined as  that guy who got captured in 2011  I believe that front line journalism is important  you know   without these photos and videos and first hand experience  we can t really tell the world how bad it might be  he said One of the journalists detained with Foley in Libya  Clare Morgana Gillis  said his fundraising for Hammerl s family was  the same impulse that compelled him to cut short his much needed break from reporting in Syria when a colleague went missing last summer  and to raise money for an ambulance for Aleppo s Dar al Shifa field hospital  where he spent weeks filming the plight of doctors who struggled to save lives with minimal space equipment His time as a teacher

For Foley  these were acts of service  not entirely unlike his time spent in the Teach for America program He began teaching in Phoenix in 1996  He d promise students that he d take them to the Castles and Coasters amusement park if they would come to class everyday  a fellow Teach for America alum  Sarah Fang  recalled in an essay in 2013 Foley later  taught reading and writing to inmates at the Cook County Sheriff s Boot Camp in Chicago  according to a Columbia Journalism Review feature about him Would you watch the video His journalism career

In the mid 2000s he decided to pursue a journalism career  first by enrolling at Northwestern University s well respected Medill School of Journalism and then by embedding with American troops in Iraq and Afghanistan While preparing for his first embed  he started his blog Foley freelanced for a number of news media outlets  including GlobalPost  a world news Web site founded in 2009 In 2012  he gravitated toward the spiraling conflict in Syria Fang  who kept in touch with Foley after their years teaching in Phoenix  wrote that his interest in the story there did not surprise her  He s always been willing to step into a zone where no one else wants to go  she wrote  Jim feels that society needs reporters willing to bear witness and report back the facts of history in the making And his loyalty to his colleagues meant that he wanted to be there with them on the frontlines BuzzFeed Middle East correspondent Sheera Frenkel said she last saw Foley about a week before his final trip into Syria Drinking beers at the lobby of a hotel popular among journalists  they talked  she said  about  how hard it was to move on from this job  into a life which would allow for marriage and family  He was a generous colleague  never holding back a tip  phone number  or detail that could help  and could spend hours talking over the ins and outs of a story to get it just right  Frenkel wrote in an email message  Jim was a great journalist  and I think he d like to be remembered that way  first and foremost After the news of Foley s killing spread on Tuesday  CBS News foreign correspondent Clarissa Ward changed her profile picture on Twitter to a photo of Foley wearing a helmet  a flak jacket and holding up a camera This  she said   is how I will chose to remember James   as a brave and tireless journalist with a passion for the Syrian cause READ  ISIS beheads U S  journalist  threatens another over Iraq

An additional 14 police officers have been arrested and confessed to participating in the disappearance  Murillo Karam said  bringing the total number of detainees to 50 The 14 are from the police force of Cocula  a town neighboring Iguala  where the confrontation took place in the southern state of Guerrero Both the mayor and police chief of Iguala are fugitives and accused of links to the local drug cartel  Guerrero Unidos  believed to have worked with police in disappearing the students The gang controls drug routes in Guerrero and Morelos states Murillo Karam said that officials had yet to identify the masterminds or a motive in the attack  but that the collusion might have gone beyond just one town  There s a connection We will determine if it was coordination or subordination  but it s clear to me that they were working together  he said of police and drug traffickers in the area Police opened fire on about 100 students who had hijacked buses to return to campus after arriving in Iguala to pass the hat for their school Teachers college students are known throughout Mexico for using radical tactics to raise money and spread their leftist philosophy Six people were killed  25 wounded and dozens of students rounded up by police There has been no sign of the missing in nearly three weeks  leading investigators to comb the clandestine burial sites outside of Iguala  where drug cartels are believed to dump their enemies On Tuesday  Guerrero Gov Angel Aguirre said many of the bodies at the first site appeared to have been buried for some time  suggesting they belonged to earlier victims of criminal gangs  Some of them are not recent  some are from months ago  Aguirre told MVS radio One forensic expert  who works with federal investigators  said identification is an arduous process that takes time Charred remains like those recovered at the first mass graves can leave very little DNA for testing  If a bone is burned at more than 300 degrees  it s almost impossible to identify because the collagen is burned Because of that  criminal organizations started to adopt that technique  said Jorge Arturo Talavera  head of the bio archaeology team at the Mexico s National Institute of Anthropology and History He said the way the remains are exhumed also can affect identification If they re pulled out in a hurried manner  other identifying articles like jewelry or teeth get discarded Hundreds of teachers  students and relatives of the missing marched to the center of the state capital  Chilpancingo  on Tuesday  taking a much more solemn tone after a night of angry protests and vandalism that badly damaged the state capital building They lined up in silence as organizers passed out white flowers Some carried candles with a sprawling billboard offering a 1 million peso  75 000  reward for information On Monday  protesters demanding to know the whereabouts of the missing smashed windows at the state capital building complex in Chilpancingo  132 miles  212 kilometers  south of Mexico City  and set fire to some of the buildings Students from the school and local teachers blockaded the capital complex  pelting it with sticks  rocks and Molotov cocktails The finance secretary of Guerrero state said six buildings were affected Also Tuesday  an alleged leader of the Guerreros Unidos killed himself during a confrontation with Mexican security forces Tuesday Federal forces were carrying out an operation to capture Benjamin Mondragon  or  Benjamon  when a gunbattle broke out  National Security Commissioner Monte Alejandro Rubido said Mondragon killed himself as he was about to be arrested  Rubido said  though he had no details on how The official said it was unclear whether Mondragon was involved in the students  disappearances President Enrique Pena Nieto said the disappearances  are without doubt a topic that will lead the Mexican government at all levels to take actions that will prevent events like those in Iguala from ever occurring again He said the government  will strengthen institutions  especially those involved in law enforcement  so that they act with greater reliability and efficiency

"Macaulay Culkin Victim of Another Online Death Hoax Macaulay Culkin has been killed off again – in yet another internet hoax Back in April rumours surfaced that the troubled star had been found dead Just seven months later it’s gone and happened again Some not funny dudes thought it would be really funny to set up a Facebook page reportedly called Rip Macaulay Culkin and post a message claiming the star had died He hasn’t  by the way Oh LOL The group gained thousands of likes and although has since been removed  the news is still doing the rounds on social networks The original post is alleged to have said 

‘At about 11 a m ET on Thursday  November 06  2014  our beloved actor Macaulay Culkin passed away Macaulay Culkin was born on August 26  1980 in New York He will be missed but not forgotten Please show your sympathy and condolences by commenting on and liking this page ’

Reports said that he’d been found dead in his Manhattan appartment In truth  he’s alive and well and probably not particularly amused that some hoaxer is claiming he’s anything but Naturally the internet is not happy at this turn of events

"ISLAMIC STATE BEHEADS MISSING AMERICAN JOURNALIST JAMES WRIGHT FOLEY President Barack Obama denounced Islamic State  Isis  militants for murdering an American journalist in retaliation for US air strikes in Iraq  showing an anger he has rarely displayed in remarks about the Iraq conflict “No just god would stand for what they did yesterday and every single day ” Obama said Wednesday in brief remarks from Edgerton  Massachusetts  where he is vacationing Hours after US intelligence authenticated a gruesome Isis videotape showing the execution of captive journalist James Foley  an act committed with the goal of deterring future US strikes on Isis  Obama said that Isis “has no place in the 21st century ” and called on allies to help defeat a “cancer so it does not spread ”

Obama did not announce any intensification of his bombing campaign  now in its thirteenth day US Central Command has yet to announce any new strikes since the Tuesday appearance of the social media borne Foley video  although sporadic reports from Iraq have indicated some may have taken place Wednesday An emotional Obama ran through a litany of Isis human rights abuses  from rape to enslavement  calling them “cowardly acts of violence ” In a vague reference to Americans held captive by Isis or near its path in Iraq  Obama said the US would “do everything we can to protect our people ” a formulation that has preceded US military action in the past With the death of the first American in Iraq since the US military withdrew in 2011  pressure is mounting on Obama to expand his already growing and amorphous air war against Isis The stated purpose of nearly two weeks of bombing has moved from the rescue of mostly Yazidi Iraqi civilians at risk of genocide to providing air cover for Kurdish and Iraqi forces wresting the strategically vital Mosul Dam away from Isis Aides to Obama pointed out from the start that threats to critical infrastructure would likely prompt a US reprisal Buffeted between calls to destroy Isis and criticism of their shifting rationale  Obama and the Pentagon have strenuously objected to a charge of mission creep They point out the consistency of the goals Obama has articulated since 8 August  preventing humanitarian catastrophe and protecting US personnel in Iraq Yet both are broad enough to encompass aerial protection of Iraqi Kurdistan and the destruction of Isis vehicles  artillery and fixed positions from Mount Sinjar to the Mosul Dam The murder of Foley – delivered after he gave a statement at knifepoint blaming the US for his death – and Isis’s threat to kill another American journalist  Steven Sotloff  is also testing Obama’s goal of safeguarding US nationals in a country overrun by Isis National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said Wednesday that the video showed both Foley and Sotloff Leaders from the UK  France and other countries lined up to excoriate Isis for the slaying British prime minister David Cameron called it “shocking” and cut short his summer holiday to chair meetings on a response A particularly acute concern for the UK government is the British accent heard from Foley’s masked killer US intelligence believes hundreds of westerners  including Americans  have joined Isis In the UK  Scotland Yard’s counter terrorism command  SO15  launched an investigation into the video as leading linguistics experts said the man sounded like he was from London or the south east of England The British foreign secretary  Philip Hammond  said of the video  “All the hallmarks point to it being genuine We’re very concerned by the apparent fact that the murderer in question is British and we are urgently investigating – agencies on both sides of the Atlantic – are first of all looking to authenticate the video  to make sure that it is genuine  and sadly it appears to be  and then to see if we can identify the individual in question ”

A spokesman for German chancellor Angela Merkel called Foley’s murder barbaric Laurent Fabius  the French foreign minister  said it exposed Isis as the “caliphate of barbarism” French president Francois Hollande told Le Monde that a global effort “beyond the traditional debate of intervention or non intervention” was necessary to confront Isis  and proposed an international meeting next month With a brutality so severe it prompted al Qaida to divorce it from the terrorist franchise  Isis has fulfilled a jihadist aspiration to carve out a state It flies a flag  sets up internal police to govern its subjects’ adherence to its interpretation of Islamic laws and customs  and maintains financial viability through the control of seized oil assets While other jihadist entities employ terrorist and insurgent tactics  for which infiltration of another’s populace is central  Isis has mustered a highly mobile army that seizes and holds territory Foley’s killer emphasized in a propaganda video that Isis is a state  not a terrorist group  a distinction that is fundamental to the group’s prestige On Wednesday  Obama repeatedly called Isis “terrorists ”

The Committee to Protect Journalists said the murder of Foley  40  who went missing during a reporting trip to Syria in 2012  “sickens all decent people” “Foley went to Syria to show the plight of the Syrian people  to bear witness to their fight  and in so doing to fight for press freedom ” Sandra Mims Rowe  the group’s chair  said in a statement In a Facebook message attributed to her  Foley’s mother Diane said  “We have never been prouder of our son Jim He gave his life trying to expose the world to the suffering of the Syrian people ” She also asked the media and the public to respect her family’s privacy Obama hailed Foley  who he called Jim  and said he had called Foley’s parents Foley’s murder  Obama said  was “an act of violence that shocks the conscience of the entire world ”",0,122

It was learnt that declarations of the cleric caused quite a stir in the catholic clergy of the archdiocese over the last few days  causing the Archbishop to summon a press conference to try and calm the rumors Despite the disapproval of his superiors  Father O’neal says that he will continue dedicating his life to God and spread the word of the “Holy Mother” The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston has not confirmed however  if they will allow Father O’neal to resume his preaching in his former parish in South Boston ",0,124

Animals treated at Toll Barn vets  North Walsham

Vet Faye Bethell used tiny instruments to remove one lump close to the fish’s anus  and another from its dorsal fin The fish lover had taken the sick  three inch pet for a consultation at North Walsham’s Toll Barn Veterinary Centre  according to Miss Bethell  29 At first he had baulked at the price quoted for the treatment and went away But he had returned five minutes later and asked for it to go ahead Goldfish  which can be bought for less than £3 each  can live up to 10 years The ailing fish  which has made a full recovery  was two years and 10 months old at the time of its operation Fishy facts
■ Goldfish  which can be bought for less than £3 each  can live up to 10 years ■ Goldfish have a memory span of at least three months ■ Goldfish can grow more than a foot long  but can be stunted by being kept in tanks too small for them and where the water quality is poor ■ Goldfish have no eyelids  so they have to sleep with their eyes open ■ Goldfish have been kept as pets for more than 2 000 years ■ The collective noun for goldfish is a “glint” or a “troubling” The delicate procedure  which lasted about 50 minutes  involved introducing a carefully measured anaesthetising agent into the fish’s water As it lost its balance  it was removed from its tank and placed on a waterproof drape The anaesthetic water was then introduced into its mouth via a tube and bubbled over its gills  through which it breathes Using a miniature heart rate monitor  Miss Bethell checked that the fish was properly “under” before using a mini scalpel to remove the lumps She then sewed each cut with three stitches  finally using a special “glue” to cover and waterproof the fish’s scales before it was gradually re awakened Working with some weird and wonderful creatures
Taking lumps off goldfish is all in a day’s work for vet Faye Bethell  who spent one morning this week castrating a skunk Cadbury  the chocolate skunk  had been brought in for the snip by his Scratby Garden Centre owners Since opening Toll Barn vets’ a year ago  specialising in exotics  Miss Bethell has performed a varied range of operations They include

Web of confusion as scientists cast doubt on man s claims that a spider burrowed into his stomach through his SCAR There s a story currently making the rounds about an Australian man who  upon returning from a trip to Bali  discovered that a spider burrowed under his skin and traveled up to his chest Freaky Yes  but it s also not plausible Rest easy  arachnophobes You do not have to worry about Charlotte weaving her web beneath your flesh The supposed story goes like this  Dylan Thomas  a 21 year old man  not the dead poet  was on vacation in Bali and woke up one morning to discover a red  trail  of irritation running from his navel to his chest  a trail that continued to grow longer throughout the day Thomas says that  after initially being sent home with antihistamines  he returned to the medical center where doctors discovered a tiny tropical spider beneath his skin Supposedly  they removed the creature through an incision and placed it in a specimen jar According to Thomas  his doctors speculated that it had entered his skin through an appendectomy scar and just kept moving up his body Thomas told various news outlets that he believes the spider was there for three days It s the kind of story that has a lot of people saying   NOPE  and a lot of arachnologists saying simply   No  that didn t happen Thomas may have been told that a spider invaded his flesh  but the arachnologists we spoke to about this story sincerely doubt that one actually did  I think this is extremely suspect  unusual  and likely not possible  Christopher Buddle  associate professor at McGill University s Department of Natural Resource Sciences  told us in an email  Simply put  it is not plausible and I can think of no valid reason why a spider might  crawl beneath skin through a scar The claim that it was  feeding and moving up through the scar tissue  defies logic and defies what we know about the biology of spiders I am also sceptical because the  evidence   the spider itself  is not presented Dr  Charles E  Griswold  Schlinger Curator of Arachnology  Emeritus  at the California Academy of Sciences  said he couldn t comment on this particular incident  but was similarly skeptical  I n general this is impossible and there is no reason that a spider would do that  he wrote Could it be that doctors pulled something other than a spider from Thomas  body Maybe  but we should wait to hear if more information comes out about the specimen Buddle told us   Other arthropods  e g  ticks mites perhaps some insects  could  possibly  be  associated  with something like this… perhaps But certainly not a spider Marie Herberstein  Head of the Department of Biological Sciences at Macquarie University in New South Wales  doesn t fully exclude the possibility that this could be a spider  though she writes   I have never heard of any spider to crawl or exist under the skin or integument of any other creature  there are no parasites amongst spiders But she also suspects it may be a different animal She told us   My initial reaction is that this is a mite  also 8 legged  rather than a spider  and mites are renown ed  for this type of behaviour  such as in scabies Let s see what the identification brings Top photo  An actual spider from Bali  taken by Lip Kee CC Attribution ShareAlike 2 0 ,0,130

"How did a Texas plumber s truck end up with Syrian rebels  video  What happened when Texas City plumbers put a black pickup truck up for auction more than a year ago This week  Mark Oberholtzer is among those trying to piece together the story An Islamic extremist group in Syria was photographed opening fire off of the back of that very same F 250 truck — the company’s name and phone number printed on the side — and that image is now circulating around the Internet A representative of Mr  Oberholtzer’s company  Mark 1 Plumbing Company  tells CBS News that the company lost track of the truck after selling it to an AutoNation dealership in Houston last year Were members of the Ansar al Deen Front – or their reps – operating in Texas buying used trucks Or was there a more indirect path Some observers have speculated that it must have taken many  many trades to get from the American South to the Middle East But Andrew Collins  who oversees Jalopnik com’s “Truck Yeah ” vertical  says the path from Texas to Syria may be shorter than some may think “If he traded it in  he would have no idea where it’s going ” Mr  Collins says “The highest bidder takes it  and they can do whatever they want ”

The truck could have been put on a cargo ship bound for a Middle East car dealer within days Car auctions  held several times each week  attract both used car dealers and exporters  he says Exporters comprise a small minority of auction attendees and purchase cars that  generally  are in worse condition than the ones that American used car dealers buy  Collins says  who has also written about the auto industry for The Christian Science Monitor Exporters then ship the cars overseas  where they are fixed up and resold “The next person to buy it could have been the exporter who sold it to the militants ” says Collins  who himself bid in auto auctions for a car dealership for about a year “I don’t know if ISIS has representatives in the car buying world — I don’t know anything about them But  exporters  could have shipped it to Syria and sold it to the people who mounted weapons on it It still would have been a few steps removed from the original seller  but I don’t think it had to be that complex ”

An AutoNation manager would not comment on the vehicle’s sale history to CBS News Oberholtzer tells the Galveston County Daily News that he received a thousand calls and faxes between Monday afternoon and Tuesday evening about the photo of his pickup truck Oberholtzer’s son  Jeff  tells ABC News that he has received threatening phone calls from around the country Call Mark 1 Plumbing for all your anti aircraft needs  https t co jVqhxvnij3

Israeli Canadian Woman  Captured  By ISIS Says She Is  Safe And Secure  Sources in the Kurdish underground in Syria denied Sunday night that Canadian Israeli Gill Rosenberg  31  had been in the Kobane region  as claimed by Islamist and Palestinian websites that reported she was captured by ISIS during the fighting in that area The report about Rosenberg s capture has not been confirmed by ISIS An American who is fighting in the ranks of the Kurds told Voice of Israel that Rosenberg was not in the Kobane region “She was never in Kobane  that s not reasonable that she was captured ” he said The head of the station s foreign news desk  Eran Sikorel  said that he  too  had information that Rosenberg had been stationed in eastern Syria and not in the Kobane region  which is in central Syria Yisrael Hayom quotes a senior Kurdish source who confirmed that Rosenberg joined the Kurdish resistance in Syria and said she was the first western woman to join its fighters The source added that ten other western citizens who are not of Kurdish origin have also joined the Kurdish fighters in recent days Earlier on Sunday  the monitoring group SITE said Islamic State  ISIS  jihadists claimed a  female Zionist soldier  had been captured in the embattled Syrian border town Some jihadists said the woman might be Rosenberg  who had served in the Israel Defense Forces and had volunteered to fight with the Kurds  the monitoring group said  The Government of Canada is aware of reports that a Canadian citizen was kidnapped in Syria  a foreign ministry statement said  according to AFP  Canada is pursuing all appropriate channels to seek further information and officials are in close contact with local authorities  added the statement Israel  too  said it was following reports about Rosenberg ,0,133
"More American Weapons for ISIS There it was in the middle of a field  baking in the sun  a cache of grenades  rockets and guns The trove was attached to a big black parachute and  as the camera focused in on the shipment  it seemed for a moment abandoned Then you see the masked man  who sermonized for the occasion An American airdrop of arms  he said  which had been intended for Kurdish fighters defending the city of Kobane  had fallen into the hands of the Islamic State “These are some of the American aid  items  that were dropped for the atheists in the” Kurdistan Workers’ Party ” the militant said in a video uploaded to jihadist social media accounts and initially reported by SITE Intelligence Group “Ammunition  military equipment  additional equipment — these are some of the military weapons The American forces dropped  them  … Praise be to Allah Spoils for the mujahideen ”

News of the accidental airdrop  which the Associated Press corroborated and the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights confirmed  brought fresh criticism to a military tactic — the air drop — officials said has become substantially more accurate in the past few decades  but is still evidently prone to screw ups And those screw ups have popped up several times so far in the battle against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria  underscoring the dangers of trusting the winds to carry valuable resources to their targets In early August  the U S  military dropped more than 7 000 gallons of water and 36 000 packaged meals onto a barren mountain near Sinjar  the hiding spot for nearly 40 000 Yazidis who fled the Islamic State under threat of genocide Many packages reached their intended targets — the Department of Defense estimated 80 percent — but not all of them did “Iraqi officials said that much of the U S  aid had been ‘useless’ because it was dropped from 15 000 feet without parachutes and exploded on impact ” wrote journalist Jonathan Krohn  who claimed to be the first Western journalist on the scene The Washington Post’s Liz Sly agreed  saying the drops “apparently went awry ”

Then NBC News reported late last month Iraqi military pilots accidentally dropped food  water and weapons to Islamic State fighters instead of to their own soldiers  who were battling to retain control of Anbar province “Some pilots  instead of dropping these supplies over the area of the Iraqi army  threw it over an area that is controlled by ISIS fighters ” Hakim al Zamili said  using another name for the Islamic State “Those soldiers were in deadly need of these supplies  but because of the wrong plans of the commanders in the Iraqi army and lack of experience of the pilots  we in a way or another helped ISIS fighters to kill our soldiers ”

Another general sheepishly added  “Yes  that’s what had happened ”

The embarrassing anecdotes feed into the complicated history of the airdrop  which still carries risks despite being honed over decades with technological advancements such as GPS guided parachutes “There’s no way you can predict who may end up with those weapons  and who is going to use them  or how they are going to use them ” Greg Myre of the Middle East Institute told the Daily Sabah “That is one of the risks you have to take ”

It was a risk Bill Clinton was willing to take in 1993 That was the year he ordered an airdrop of tens of thousands of humanitarian packages over eastern Bosnia  despite the “military consistently arguing against involving U S  troops in airdrops in hostile zones  given the fact that the accuracy of the drops is questionable ” the Associated Press then reported The brass turned out to be right One major problem laid bare during that mission  military scientists later said  was what they called “wind drift ” “The problem was identified in the late ’90s ” John McGinley  a scientist who researched the topic  told The Washington Post’s Holly Watt in 2008 “The terrain in Bosnia meant that instead of landing in one valley  the cargo could drift into another valley that was held by the enemy Wind drift was causing all the problems ”

So research teams got to work  ultimately unveiling wind forecast software that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said increased the drop’s accuracy by 70 percent “Inaccurate wind forecasts are the main culprit in missed targets for dropping supplies and other items from high altitudes ” the report said It almost immediately went into use in the war in Afghanistan  where far flung military outposts were separated by stretches of roads pockmarked with insurgents and explosives There had to be another way to get soldiers the equipment they needed  military officials thought  so they launched a massive increase in airdrops “We’ve gotten a lot more accurate over the years ” Air Force Gen  Arthur Lichte told USA Today That may true But following this week’s alleged delivery to the Islamic State  there’s clearly still room for work ",0,134

"The “Flood Libel” Propagandists of 2015 The proliferation of online news outlets has democratized newsgathering  but it’s also updated the famous adage that “there’s a sucker born every minute” for the Internet age And no circus attracts the suckers quite like the Arab Israeli conflict Not only will people believe anything about Israel  their editors will let them write it And as we learned yesterday  pretty much every year someone will fall for the impossibly preposterous accusation known as the “flood libel ”

There are moments when biased coverage of Israel goes beyond mere opinion Last year  the good folks at Vox  a notoriously error ridden site  declared the existence of a bridge connecting the West Bank and Gaza It was not a maddening mistake  it was  rather  kind of endearing It was adorable  in its own way But that such a bridge does not exist is an easily verifiable fact Same goes for New York Times Jerusalem bureau chief Jodi Rudoren’s claim in 2012 that prospective Jewish construction in the West Bank would bisect the West Bank and make physical contiguity impossible As was subsequently pointed out  and corrected accordingly  this was not even close to being true and Rudoren would have known as much had she glanced at a map And this week we were treated to another version of this story  though it’s one we hear often enough It’s a bit of a hazing ritual  the Palestinians find someone they haven’t yet sold this particular lie to and watch the magic unfold The lie is this  that flooding in Gaza was caused by Israel opening dams in the South Easily the most important part of this story is the fact that there are no such dams They are the Gaza West Bank bridge of this story And yet  the story just keeps appearing because the Palestinians never run out of Western suckers One of the suckers this year was Vice News To try to hide its ignorance  Vice offered up several paragraphs of false accusations from the Palestinians followed by this attempt at “balance”  “Israeli officials categorically denied they were to blame while speaking to VICE News on Monday ”

Other outlets were more honest and ethical in the aftermath of publishing the flood libel As HonestReporting notes  the Daily Mail went with a bit of false balance but also  crucially  added a straight correction and admission of error  “An earlier version of this article stated that Israel had opened river dams in the south of the country  causing flooding in the Gaza strip In fact  there are no dams in southern Israel and the flooding was caused by rain and drainage issues We are happy to clarify this ”

According to HonestReporting  the Daily Mail piece also contained the following amazing sentence  “The flooding was today compounded after an Israeli power company cut electricity to two of Gaza’s major West Bank cities ”

And according to CAMERA  both Agence France Presse and Al Jazeera  shocking  I know  passed along the flood libel AFP pulled its video  and Al Jazeera went the Vice route by pretending the existence of magical dams is somehow in dispute The flood libel is proof that sometimes people refuse to learn from others’ mistakes See this post from Jonathan Tobin in December 2013 for a reminder that the flood libel is neither new nor surprising IDF spokeswoman Libby Weiss understandably would rather news organizations first locate their unicorns before blaming those unicorns for goring the neighbor’s ox 


So why does this keep happening Part of the frustration with reporters stems from their absolute laziness The Internet has put so much information within arm’s reach  and yet reporters are taught that when it comes to Israel  the facts are optional And that’s because the facts favor Israel If you were to draw a map of Israel  using Western news organizations’ reporting  you’d have one that showed Israel bisecting the West Bank while connecting it to Gaza via a bridge and holding parliamentary meetings in its capital of Tel Aviv None of that is true  but that’s the picture that emerges from the media’s “reporting ”

There also appears to be a kind of modified Stockholm Syndrome at work These reporters and the outlets they represent are constantly made to look like fools by Palestinian propaganda But they also seem not to mind  because they sympathize so strongly with what the propagandists and terrorists are telling them If what I’m describing to you sounds an awful lot like an activist  not a journalist  well–that’s about right And such activists play a key role in disseminating grist for the anti Semitic mill The first headline is the one that makes waves  especially in the Arab world and in Europe If the follow up is not a full retraction or correction  but rather a “balanced” piece in which Israel is permitted to deny the existence of things that plainly don’t exist  then it casts the Israeli government as a powerful entity engaged in a cover up It would be bad enough if we were forced to admit that our media just can’t get the story right But that’s naïve The truth is  much of the time our media just won’t get it right And that’s why the flood libel returns  year after year ",0,145

"Bodies In Mexico Mass Grave Apparently Not Those Of Missing Students CHILPANCINGO  Mexico  AP  — Authorities testing remains found in nine mass graves in southern Mexico have yet to find any of 43 teachers college students who disappeared after a confrontation with police  security officials said Tuesday None were among 28 bodies  some badly burned  that were unearthed a week after the Sept  26 attack  Attorney General Jesus Murillo Karam said Forensic investigators continued to test other remains and announced the discovery of 10th mass grave Tuesday Relatives of missing students march with flowers and candles to protest the disappearance of 43 students from the Isidro Burgos rural teachers college in Chilpancingo  Mexico  Tuesday  Oct  14  2014 According to Mexico s attorney general none of the missing students were among the bodies found in the first set of mass graves outside the town Authorities have said police involved in  disappearing  the students were working in conjunction with a local drug gang  AP Photo Eduardo Verdugo 

An additional 14 police officers have been arrested and confessed to participating in the disappearance  Murillo Karam said  bringing the total number of detainees to 50 The 14 are from the police force of Cocula  a town neighboring Iguala  where the confrontation took place in the southern state of Guerrero Both the mayor and police chief of Iguala are fugitives and accused of links to the local drug cartel  Guerrero Unidos  believed to have worked with police in disappearing the students The gang controls drug routes in Guerrero and Morelos states Murillo Karam said that officials had yet to identify the masterminds or a motive in the attack  but that the collusion might have gone beyond just one town  There s a connection We will determine if it was coordination or subordination  but it s clear to me that they were working together  he said of police and drug traffickers in the area Police opened fire on about 100 students who had hijacked buses to return to campus after arriving in Iguala to pass the hat for their school Teachers college students are known throughout Mexico for using radical tactics to raise money and spread their leftist philosophy Six people were killed  25 wounded and dozens of students rounded up by police There has been no sign of the missing in nearly three weeks  leading investigators to comb the clandestine burial sites outside of Iguala  where drug cartels are believed to dump their enemies On Tuesday  Guerrero Gov Angel Aguirre said many of the bodies at the first site appeared to have been buried for some time  suggesting they belonged to earlier victims of criminal gangs  Some of them are not recent  some are from months ago  Aguirre told MVS radio One forensic expert  who works with federal investigators  said identification is an arduous process that takes time Charred remains like those recovered at the first mass graves can leave very little DNA for testing  If a bone is burned at more than 300 degrees  it s almost impossible to identify because the collagen is burned Because of that  criminal organizations started to adopt that technique  said Jorge Arturo Talavera  head of the bio archaeology team at the Mexico s National Institute of Anthropology and History He said the way the remains are exhumed also can affect identification If they re pulled out in a hurried manner  other identifying articles like jewelry or teeth get discarded Hundreds of teachers  students and relatives of the missing marched to the center of the state capital  Chilpancingo  on Tuesday  taking a much more solemn tone after a night of angry protests and vandalism that badly damaged the state capital building They lined up in silence as organizers passed out white flowers Some carried candles with a sprawling billboard offering a 1 million peso  75 000  reward for information On Monday  protesters demanding to know the whereabouts of the missing smashed windows at the state capital building complex in Chilpancingo  132 miles  212 kilometers  south of Mexico City  and set fire to some of the buildings Students from the school and local teachers blockaded the capital complex  pelting it with sticks  rocks and Molotov cocktails The finance secretary of Guerrero state said six buildings were affected Also Tuesday  an alleged leader of the Guerreros Unidos killed himself during a confrontation with Mexican security forces Tuesday Federal forces were carrying out an operation to capture Benjamin Mondragon  or  Benjamon  when a gunbattle broke out  National Security Commissioner Monte Alejandro Rubido said Mondragon killed himself as he was about to be arrested  Rubido said  though he had no details on how The official said it was unclear whether Mondragon was involved in the students  disappearances President Enrique Pena Nieto said the disappearances  are without doubt a topic that will lead the Mexican government at all levels to take actions that will prevent events like those in Iguala from ever occurring again He said the government  will strengthen institutions  especially those involved in law enforcement  so that they act with greater reliability and efficiency

Murren didn’t identify the person who ran up the six figure bill  but Bloomberg reporters quickly connected the dinner to Smith  who at the time of the meal was in the midst of a hot run at the blackjack tables  which was apparently witnessed by the late New York Times media columnist David Carr 
The Times’ Dealbook blog later reported that Smith’s gambling winnings exceeded  1 million  citing anonymous people who attended the dinner With accounts of the guestlist ranging from 12 to 30  it’s hard to imagine how the outspoken Smith and his guests ran up such a stupendous tab without buying some monumentally expensive booze A 28 oz bone in rib eye  Prime’s most expensive dish  sells for  85  pan roasted Dover sole will run you  66  and a lobster tail goes for  62—but the steakhouse’s wine list includes bottles that sell for more than  20 000 A Vice spokesman did not respond to requests for comment The media company recently secured a  500 million funding round that values it at more than  2 5 billion Smith also has yet to comment on the dinner Perhaps he thinks MGM has already said enough ",0,159

"China  Satirical site warns citizens over name choices update

This story was a hoax written by a site which appeared to be the English language website of the Chinese state run broadcaster  CCTV And we fell for it The original blog post  which was cited by us and other publishers  was published at cctvnews cn The fake site used CCTV’s logo and embedded tweets from the official  CCTVNEWS Twitter account The actual URL of CCTV English is english cntv cn However  an internet directory search shows that the fake CCTVNews site – which is now offline – is based in Hangzhou  1 300 miles from CCTV’s real headquarters in Beijing BF STATIC timequeue push function     document getElementById update article update time 4429703 innerHTML   UI dateFormat get formatted date 2014 12 08 04 28 40  0500   update   

This week CCTV News  the state run broadcaster  came up with these tips for any Chinese people considering an English name – one of which is to steer clear of “Dumbledore” It’s common for Chinese people to choose an English name  partly to make conversation with non Chinese speakers easier Many Chinese students in western colleges go by an English name  for example But as CCTV points out  some people are choosing names that might sound odd to English speakers The article says  “While native English speakers are stuck with whatever happy or unhappy names they’ve been given  Chinese and other ‘non natives’ get the lucky choice of picking their own English name “However these choices can mean more than you think ”

Religious  mythical  and fictional characters such as Vampire  Satan  Medusa  and Edward Cullen are a no no “Unique names like these aren’t just very amusing to English speakers  it also suggests you have some connection to that name ” the article warns “So if you call yourself Satan  you might get a few foreigners thinking you’re anti Christian  or possibly a member of a heavy metal band ”

CCTV says Harry is OK  if you’re a Harry Potter fan  but only because it was a common name to start with Also on the “no” list are common everyday words that aren’t used as names in English  such as Lawyer Other examples include Surprise  Dragon  and Fish – things that might be related to the characters in someone’s Chinese name “Sure  have fun and pick a random object or word as a name  but avoid them if you want a call back from that serious law firm in America ” CCTV says CCTV closes the article with this advice for anyone thinking of an English name 

A good way to work out the ‘feeling’ of a name is to watch a bunch of American movies and sitcoms They’re full of name stereotypes – you’ll find the good girls’ are all ‘Janes’  the jock boys are still ‘Buds’ and the geeks are called ‘Sheldon’ ",0,162

One of the U S  officials said President Barack Obama was expected to make a statement about the killing on Wednesday The U S  officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the video by name Foley  a 40 year old freelance journalist from Rochester  New Hampshire  went missing nearly two years ago in northern Syria while on assignment for Agence France Press and the Boston based media company GlobalPost The car he was riding in was stopped by four militants in a contested battle zone that both Sunni rebel fighters and government forces were trying to control He had not been heard from since Several senior U S  officials with direct knowledge of the situation said the Islamic State very recently threatened to kill Foley to avenge the crushing airstrikes over the last two weeks against militants advancing on Mount Sinjar  the Mosul dam and the Kurdish capital of Irbil Both areas are in northern Iraq  which has become a key front for the Islamic State as its fighters travel to and from Syria The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the hostage situation by name Since Aug  8  the U S  military has struck more than 70 Islamic State targets – including security checkpoints  vehicles and weapons caches It’s not clear how many militants have been killed in the strikes  although it’s likely that some were The Internet video begins with scenes of President Barack Obama explaining his decision to order airstrikes in Iraq Then it switches to a balding man in an orange jumpsuit kneeling in the desert  a black clad Islamic State fighter by his side Foley’s name appears in both English and Arabic graphics on screen The video appears to have been shot in an arid area  there is no vegetation in sight and the horizon is in the distance where the sand meets the gray blue sky The New York based Committee to Protect Journalists estimated Tuesday that about 20 journalists are missing in Syria  and has not released their nationalities In its annual report last November  CPJ concluded that the missing journalists are either being held and threatened with death by extremists  or taken captive by gangs seeking ransom The group’s report described the widespread seizure of journalists as unprecedented and largely unreported by news organizations in the hope that keeping the kidnappings out of public view may help in the captives’ release The Islamic State militant group is so ruthless in its attacks against all people they consider heretics or infidels that it has been disowned by al Qaida’s leaders In seeking to impose its harsh interpretation of Islamic law in the lands it is trying to control  the extremists have killed soldiers and civilians alike in horrifying executions – including mounting the decapitated heads of some of its victims on spikes The group is the heir apparent of the militancy known as al Qaida in Iraq  which beheaded many of its victims  including Americans businessman Nicholas Berg in 2004 ",0,165

"Spider Burrows Into Australian Man s Appendix Scar  VIDEO  A trip to Bali has turned Dylan Thomas into a real life Spiderman The 21 year old was holidaying with friends last weekend when he woke up to find a strange red trail stretching up his stomach Doctors told Mr Thomas he had just been bitten by a small insect when he fronted Bali International Medical Centre on Sunday morning after the red mark started to grow in length  the NT News reports Scroll down for video

Dylan Thomas  21  was holidaying with friends last weekend when he woke up to find a strange red trail stretching up his stomach

Doctors at Bali International Medical Centre initially thought he had just been bitten by a small insect and gave him an antihistamine When it started to blister the next day  he knew some was wrong

So imagine his surprise when doctors discovered a tropical spider burrowing just below his skin a day later Mr Thomas  who recently returned to his Bunbury home in Western Australia  was initially given an antihistamine cream to treat the mark But the next morning when he found it had started to blister  Mr Thomas went to see a dermatologist Doctors retrieved the spider from his abdomen  which had burrowed its way through a small scar from a previous operation where he had his appendix removed

The 21 year old has since returned to his Bunbury home in WA but is yet to find out what kind of spider it was

Doctors retrieved the spider from his abdomen  which had burrowed its way through a small scar from a previous operation where he had his appendix removed  It was a bit bigger than the size of a match head  Mr Thomas told the newspaper  It takes a lot to deter me  but I do feel violated It was a very bizarre experience just to know something like that was in my body for a couple of days The tropical spider was taken away for testing and Mr Thomas will soon be told exactly what kind of spider it was ",0,167

"Everybody Relax  Banksy Wasn’t Arrested And Exposed As A 35 Year Old Man If you’ve seen a story floating around on your Facebook feed about Banksy getting arrested and exposed  don’t worry because Banksy is still anonymous and well The hoax was the work of a “satirical” news site called The National Report — which I’m not linking because f ck those guys — that makes up fake stories that sound like they could be ostensibly true  usually without a trace of actual satire  as filthy  filthy clickbait It’s an awful yet unfortunately effective business model In a story which was published early this morning  The National Report claimed that Banksy was arrested in London by a 24 hour Anti Graffiti Task Force and revealed to be a 35 year old man named Paul Horner The International Business Times did some quick fact checking and exposed the story to be a hoax 

Paul Horner is the name given to a Facebook spokesperson who said the site will soon be charging users  2 99 a month – another hoax story that comes around every now and again – as well as the name from a hoax story about a 15 year old Louisiana teen who was sentenced to 25 years to life after he called a SWAT team to another teenager’s house after he beat him while playing Battlefield 4 The article is also said to have been written by Dr Darius Rubics  a fake name for a writer who claims to have be a Pulitzer prize winning reporter but who  unsurprisingly since his previous stories include ‘Obama Declares November National Muslim Appreciation Month’ and ‘Dennis Rodman Leaves US To Talk With Leaders Of Isis’  has never been awarded any prizes for excellence in journalism HAHA get it It’s funny because it’s not true I guess there’s some logic in there somewhere It’s not even entertaining to see people share stories that come from places like the The National Report since they’re designed to trick — unlike when dumb people share stories from The Onion  which are designed to actually be satire Again  and I cannot stress this enough  F ck those guys ",0,172
"Lego letter from the 1970s still offers a powerful message to parents 40 years later Over the weekend  Reddit user fryd  posted a letter that Lego included in boxes of its toy building bricks in the 1970s Addressed to parents  the note has a message about gender equality and gendered children s products that many toy companies today still don t seem to understand The letter reads 

To Parents The urge to create is equally strong in all children Boys and girls It’s the imagination that counts Not skill You build whatever comes into your head  the way you want it A bed or a truck A dolls house or a spaceship A lot of boys like dolls houses They’re more human than spaceships A lot of girls prefer spaceships They’re more exciting than dolls houses The most important thing is to put the right material in their hands and let them create whatever appeals to them The Reddit user told Buzzfeed that he found the note while playing with Legos with his niece and nephew at their grandmother s house  It struck me as particularly modern message for something written 40 years ago  he said  adding   I thought the toy makers of today could learn a thing or two This letter s message is consistent with the gender neutral Lego ad from 1981 that made the Internet rounds back in February The creator of the ad  Judy Lotas  told The Huffington Post   Boys and girls are different  but not to the exclusion of wanting to create and build That’s not a gender issue Hear  hear H T Buzzfeed

"WHO says reports of suspected Ebola cases in Iraq are untrue The New York Post decided that it was a good idea to report that members of ISIS may have been infected with Ebola In other news  Andy Borowitz has been hired at the New York Post  Haha  no  kidding Can you imagine  though Apparently  the World Health Organization is investigating claims made by Iraqi newspaper Al Sabah that Ebola and HIV AIDS are spreading among residents of Mosul  brought there by  terrorists and expats from different countries  especially Africa Mosul is held by ISIS  Al Sabah is the official Iraqi government newspaper Mashable reports that the story  which originated in Al Sabah  has spread amongst other pro government and Kurdish newspapers Like a virus Might such outlets have an interest in encouraging the notion that ISIS fighters were stricken with highly stigmatized diseases Hmm Meanwhile  Forbes reported in October that ISIS maybe possibly could use Ebola as a weapon

"Microsoft Tried Out Robot Security Guards on Its Silicon Valley Campus It seems like robots are everywhere these days  and now they’re rolling around Microsofts Silicon Valley campus R2 D2 style to fight crime and keep everyone safe At least that’s the idea behind a pilot program the company ran last week to test a fleet of five K5 security guard robots Designed and manufactured by robotics company Knightscope  K5s weigh 300 pounds and are 5 feet tall They use cameras and sensors to keep track of their surroundings and look for suspcious activity They can “see” license plate numbers and even analyze faces While K5s aren’t equipped with weapons  and can’t run or get in someone’s face anyway  they do have onboard alarms and sirens to alert people if something bad is going on And if they spot something that a person should handle  they can call a human security guard over The K5s also use laser scanning and GPS for navigating  weather sensors  and  of course  Wi Fi connectivity Stacy Stephens  Knightscope’s co founder and vice president of sales and marketing  told MIT Tech Review  “This takes away the monotonous and sometimes dangerous work  and leaves the strategic work to law enforcement or private security  depending on the application ”

K5s are mostly meant for spotting strange or unusual behavior  but if you’re in trouble you can also use them to call for help They have battery life of about 24 hours and can automatically bring themselves back to their charging stations when they’re low on juice And it’s true that there’s artificial intelligence coordinating an A5’s actions and making decisions about where it should go and what it should do next But reaction to the robots seems kind of alarmist ExtremeTech writes that by testing the robots  Microsoft is “ s howing a rather shocking disregard for the long term safety of human civilization ” That and other comments might be meant as tongue in cheek  but the A5s don’t seem any different from the robot guards South Korea piloted in prisons in 2012 or even Boston Dynamics’ Atlas robot  which is designed to be used in dangerous situations like natural disaster relief or fire rescues If they were armed  A5s might seem scarier  but as eyes and ears that never get tired and can just endlessly putter around a big campus  A5s seem like a reasonable solution ",0,178

"Doubts cast over Nicaragua meteorite claim Experts have raised doubts about whether a loud boom and a gaping crater found in Nicaragua s crowded capital Managua this weekend were caused by a meteorite  as the government has said The impact near the international airport did not cause any known injuries  but it did leave a crater measuring 12 metres across and was felt throughout the capital The US National Aeronautics and Space Administration on Monday said that while a meteorite could not be ruled out  the lack so far of any eyewitness accounts of a fireball lighting up the nighttime sky outside Managua on Saturday suggests something else was likely behind the event Bill Cooke  head of NASA s Meteoroid Environment Office  estimated that the crater would have been created by a blast of roughly an energy equivalent of 1 ton of TNT NASA said in a statement that a meteor capable of that would have created a ball of flame visible over a wide area About 1 5 million people live in the Nicaraguan capital  For something to produce a hole in the ground that big  it would have generated a very bright fireball And nothing was reported   despite the population  Cooke said  So I m very sceptical Nicaraguan authorities believe it was a piece of the small asteroid dubbed  2014 RC  which passed very close to Earth and was estimated by astronomers to be about 20 meters big  or the size of a house  Fascinating event 

Government officials and experts visited the impact site on Sunday One of them  William Martinez  said it was not yet clear if the meteorite burned up completely or if it had been blasted into the soil  You can see mirror like spots on the sides of the crater from where the meteorite power scraped the walls  Martinez said Government spokeswoman  First Lady Rosario Murillo  said Nicaraguan authorities would be in contact with the US Geological Service to try to get more information about  this fascinating event  in the Central American nation  one of Latin America s poorest countries People who live near the crater told local media they heard a blast they took for an explosion  and that liquid  sand and dust were blown through the air  which smelled like something had burned There were no reported injuries because the impact was in a wooded spot  and flights at the airport were not affected ",0,180
"Texas City plumber s truck ends up in Syrian war What happened when Texas City plumbers put a black pickup truck up for auction more than a year ago This week  Mark Oberholtzer is among those trying to piece together the story An Islamic extremist group in Syria was photographed opening fire off of the back of that very same F 250 truck — the company’s name and phone number printed on the side — and that image is now circulating around the Internet A representative of Mr  Oberholtzer’s company  Mark 1 Plumbing Company  tells CBS News that the company lost track of the truck after selling it to an AutoNation dealership in Houston last year Were members of the Ansar al Deen Front – or their reps – operating in Texas buying used trucks Or was there a more indirect path Some observers have speculated that it must have taken many  many trades to get from the American South to the Middle East But Andrew Collins  who oversees Jalopnik com’s “Truck Yeah ” vertical  says the path from Texas to Syria may be shorter than some may think “If he traded it in  he would have no idea where it’s going ” Mr  Collins says “The highest bidder takes it  and they can do whatever they want ”

The truck could have been put on a cargo ship bound for a Middle East car dealer within days Car auctions  held several times each week  attract both used car dealers and exporters  he says Exporters comprise a small minority of auction attendees and purchase cars that  generally  are in worse condition than the ones that American used car dealers buy  Collins says  who has also written about the auto industry for The Christian Science Monitor Exporters then ship the cars overseas  where they are fixed up and resold “The next person to buy it could have been the exporter who sold it to the militants ” says Collins  who himself bid in auto auctions for a car dealership for about a year “I don’t know if ISIS has representatives in the car buying world — I don’t know anything about them But  exporters  could have shipped it to Syria and sold it to the people who mounted weapons on it It still would have been a few steps removed from the original seller  but I don’t think it had to be that complex ”

An AutoNation manager would not comment on the vehicle’s sale history to CBS News Oberholtzer tells the Galveston County Daily News that he received a thousand calls and faxes between Monday afternoon and Tuesday evening about the photo of his pickup truck Oberholtzer’s son  Jeff  tells ABC News that he has received threatening phone calls from around the country Call Mark 1 Plumbing for all your anti aircraft needs  https t co jVqhxvnij3

No  a spider  probably  didn t crawl through a man s body for several days Fear not arachnophobes  the story of Bunbury s  spiderman  might not be all it seemed Perth scientists have cast doubt over claims that a spider burrowed into a man s body during his first trip to Bali The story went global on Thursday  generating hundreds of stories online Earlier this month  Dylan Thomas headed to the holiday island and sought medical help after experiencing  a really burning sensation like a searing feeling  in his abdomen Dylan Thomas says he had a spider crawl underneath his skin Thomas said a specialist dermatologist was called in and later used tweezers to remove what was believed to be a  tropical spider But it seems we may have all been caught in a web  of misinformation Arachnologist Dr Volker Framenau said whatever the creature was  it was  almost impossible  for the culprit to have been a spider  If you look at a spider  the fangs  the mouth parts they have  they are not able to burrow They can t get through skin  he said  We thought it may have been something like a mite  there are a few different parasitic mites out there  which can sometimes look a bit like a spider I can t think of any spider which could do this to a person Dr Mark Harvey from the Western Australian Museum agreed and said he found the case  bizarre  I must confess I was amazed because I ve never heard of a spider being able to survive under the skin of a human  or indeed any mammal  he said  Spiders need air to breathe  they have spiracles on the sides of their bodies where air comes into their system through a series of what we call book lungs Being under the skin of somebody  I would have thought they wouldn t have enough air to survive  Even if it was a mite  I ve never seen anything like this Even if it was an insect  I ve never heard of an insect crawling under the skin like this  so it really is a remarkable case Dr Harvey said spiders were widely feared in the community and often were the subject of urban legends  We hear about people going on holidays and having spiders lay eggs under the skin Then  the baby spiders  burst out when they return from their holiday in the tropics  he said  None of those are true  they re just made up stories  They re not actually able to dig through the skin  that s why this case is so unusual Some can burrow into soil  but they have to remove soil particles one at a time if they want to do that Something which is true  according to Dr Harvey  is that certain arachnids do  live on humans  We all have mites living on our faces They re follicle mites  but they re absolutely miniscule and you can t see them We transmit them to our children when we have kids  he said  They live in the bases of hair follicles on our faces and in some of the pores in our skin Those mites are so small  you can t see them  and they re not going to cause a blemish on the skin like this lad has on his stomach Dr Framenau said that much of the confusion could be eliminated by keeping or catching the creepy crawly offender  dead or alive  and enlisting the help of experts  It would be great if they collected it or took a photo of it  he said  If you have been bitten by something  the best thing you can do is collect it and submit it to a museum for identification before these things go viral Dylan Thomas has been contacted for comment   WA Today,0,182

"University Bans Word ‘Freshman’ Because It’s Sexist and Promotes Rape Elon University in North Carolina banned the word “freshman” from its website and student orientation  claiming it’s sexist and suggests that the young women might make good rape victims It’s replacing the term with “first year ”

“The term has often been felt to refer to the vulnerableness of young women in college for the first time ” Leigh Anne Royster  the school’s “Inclusive Community Wellbeing Director” told the College Fix “Given the rates of sexual violence perpetrated against women on college campuses  it is useful to examine any use of a term that suggests that a group of people just entering college might be targets for such violence in any way ” she added In fact  the word is apparently so dangerous that any orientation leader who dared to use it was immediately corrected “They engrained over and over in our brains that it was supposed to be ‘first year ’ not ‘freshman ’” sophomore orientation leader Alaina Schukraft told the Fix “They were very adamant    and stressed the importance of using language that would make the new students feel comfortable ” 

Ironically  Schukraft said that multiple students approached her and said they were actually more comfortable with the word “freshman ”

But no matter Greg Zaiser  vice president of admissions and financial planning  insists that it will make the school a better place for women — telling the Fix that people consider “freshman” to be a “sexist” word “As an inclusive community  Elon strives to incorporate language that is current and reflective of our student body ” Zaiser said in an e mail to the Fix No public announcement was made about the word switch According to the Fix  administrators relied “largely on word of mouth ”

"Taibbi takes time out from First Look after “disagreements ” Can I publish our emails now  Matt Matt Taibbi is taking a “leave of absence” from Pierre Omidyar’s First Look Media  according to New York Magazine The move comes “after disagreements with higher ups inside Omidyar’s organization  a source close to First Look confirmed today ”

Over the last year  however  the center of gravity of the organization has shifted  as Omidyar and his Silicon Valley braintrust have exerted control over budgets and vacillated over the journalistic mission Over the summer  Omidyar appointed a longtime confidante  John Temple — a former newspaper editor who previously led an Omidyar financed civic journalism venture in Hawaii — to be the president for audience and products  putting him in a position above Eric Bates  the former Rolling Stone editor who was brought on as a First Look editorial director  who is close to Taibbi The “leave of absence” also comes three months after I first reported that Omidyar had apparently ordered Taibbi to change his strategy away from purely covering corporate fatcats  like  uh  Pierre Omidyar  to a wider mission  involving more comedy than reporting Around the same time I heard rumors that Eric Bates was also unhappy at the organization I’ve previously had a… uh… spirited email conversation with Taibbi about both claims  although Taibbi would only engage on the condition that his words were “not for publication” — a strange demand coming from an editor at a site that’s about leaking confidential documents I emailed Taibbi again today to ask if I can publish his responses in the light of today’s news He replied  “No  you may not ”

Here then  for what little it’s worth  is my side of the correspondence  from back in July  in which I laid out the state of First Look as I saw it  with a little help from some well placed sources The discussion was… uh… spirited on both sides All words below are mine — you’ll just have to try to infer what Taibbi’s stated position might have been A note on not for publication   off the record  I thought carefully about the ethics of publishing even my half of a “not for publication” conversation Given First Look’s own policy of publishing confidential documents and the fact that it seems clear Taibbi wasn’t being entirely truthful about his place at the company  I ultimately came down on the side of publishing my own responses  with Taibbi’s words redacted I’m sure some readers with disagree — I welcome the discussion Also  an important disclosure  Taibbi previously worked with Pando’s Mark Ames on Russian ex pat newspaper  the Exile It has been widely reported that the two are no longer on speaking terms I didn’t discuss this post with Mark before publishing Ok  here are the emails…

 The email thread began with Taibbi s emailing me to deny that Omidyar had changed his strategy I had emailed First Look for comment on my story before publication but received no reply Taibbi s email was headed  Not for publication From  Paul Carr To  Matt Taibbi Date  Tue  Jul 29  2014  Redacted Taibbi quote  denying my story  Right  but that’s not the part that seems to have changed What’s changed is that Omidyar’s description of the site yesterday made zero mention of wall street It’s gone from finance first to politics first More broadly  and happy to stay off the record  there’s clearly something weird going on over there Why does a 250m journalism project have to shift focus before it’s launched It suggests PO has no clue how to handle talent and so is retreating back to technology  Taibbi responded  with questions of his own Here s my reply 

From  Paul Carr To  Matt Taibbi Date  Tue  Jul 29  2014 I don’t think  Omidyar  took you aside and ordered you not to cover his friends I think either you made the decision yourself for reasons of an easier life  or his blog post was the first you heard about the change and he just publicly fucked you over Knowing what I do about his management style I’m leaning towards the latter But I emailed you because I actually want to understand what’s going on  Taibbi responded again And I replied again 

From  Paul Carr To  Matt Taibbi Date  Tue  Jul 29  2014  Redacted If I waited for Pierre and his staffers to respond to questions I’d never publish a thing about First Look I’ve given PO 48hrs to respond before  and still got nothing I’m sure you’ve always held stories indefinitely until you receive a response As for your bizarre chain of straw man arguments — I didn’t say he’d hired you to shut you up So  no  I don’t  believe  something you just made up As you say  that would be real  redacted  analysis Here’s what I believe… I don’t think Pierre has any idea why he hired you  and I don’t think you’re entirely sure either Perhaps he was looking for names that looked good on a press release and you fit the bill I think you’re tired  and I think you knew the Rolling Stone gig wasn’t going to last for ever I think PO offered you complete editorial freedom and promised you a blank check to build your own team For that reason  I think Omidyar’s announcement yesterday should be terrifying to you  and to anyone else who works at FLM He’s lost his nerve — for a combination of reasons — and is retreating to something he understands  Technology and platforms I’ve spoken to people who have known Omidyar for decades and people who have worked with him on previous publications — if you seriously think he’s going to have your back when you go after his pals you’re more naive than… well  than you are I’m tired of this conversation now I honestly can’t tell if you’re being a team player  or if you believe any of this crap I’m sure I’ll continue to cover FLM and I’ll continue to ask for comment when I do It’s entirely up to you if you respond before publication or wait until afterwards and then bitch on Twitter Either way  I’ll continue to read your Wall St stuff if when you publish it — just as I read  and enjoyed  your most recent book on a long flight a few weeks back Best of luck  Paul

 Taibbi responded again From  Paul Carr To  Matt Taibbi Date  Wed  Jul 30  2014 I’m tired of it because you refuse to actually engage in conversation I’ve laid out my position  clearly and honestly  and asked follow up questions You won’t actually address any of my points — you just keep lobbing back straw men and not engaging with what I’m saying At the very least you’ve turned into a corporate flack for First Look  Continuing to hammer away at a caricatured version of what I said  while refusing to answer questions  and demanding that the whole thing stay off the record so that readers continue to be left in the dark The last person who tried that line of attack over a Pando story was Lanny Davis  Redacted  I’ve told you what I believe  but I’ll humor you — and your enjoyment at playing PR flack — by saying it again  this time line by line…  Redacted Taibbi quote  I think it’s unlikely Pierre  ordered  you to stop writing about Wall Street I’d say the odds  are  almost zero He’s not that fucking stupid Here’s what I said “No  of course I don’t think he took you aside and ordered you not to cover his friends I think either you made the decision yourself for reasons of an easier life  or his blog post was the first you heard about the change and he just publicly fucked you over ” Here’s my question  which you don’t seem keen to answer  Did you know Pierre was going to leave finance out of his post about what your editorial mission would be If not  doesn’t that worry you If so  what is the reasoning behind not mentioning the thing that you are best known for but which is likely to make your sole funder and boss the most uncomfortable A follow up question  What are we to make of the fact that First Look journalists — Greenwald in particular — insist that Pierre has no control over editorial  indeed you’ve insisted similar in this conversation  and yet he’s the one laying out the company’s editorial plan Why wouldn’t that be the job of the actual editors Instead we have your  250m funder issuing a statement that marginalizes the one aspect of your work that might sting him while reassuring the world that — don’t worry — he intends to permit you and Greenwald to continue doing your jobs  but that he has decided to axe plans for all the other editorial sites he previously  in a video starring him  said he would fund What does the phrase “editorial independence” actually mean at First Look  Redacted Taibbi quote  I think that’s what he told you when you were first hired  yes People are told lots of things on first dates  Redacted Taibbi quote  I’ve never said otherwise That’s a total red herring  Redacted Taibbi quote   Redacted  I didn’t mention anything in my story about Pierre ordering you to stop writing  because  as I’ve made clear  I don’t believe that would make any sense  I didn’t mention what I suspect you might have been told when you were hired  because  again  I don’t know What I know — and what I wrote — is that the public statements about your mission have changed  I didn’t mention it being a satirical publication because that hasn’t changed  Redacted Taibbi quote  A press release about what your job and focus will be  written by the man who writes your pay checks and who is backing down on almost all of the editorial strategy that was in place when you were hired A press release that was at odds with all previous statements about what your focus will be  specifically leaving out the one thing that would seem to have the potential to make Omidyar most concerned Yes  I believe that means you will be focussing far less on that aspect of things and  yes  I believe that it’s either a choice you’ve consciously made  or a choice Pierre is attempting to make for you through passive aggressive public messaging Your choice of denial is interesting “ Redacted ” That’s the same line Greenwald used when he was challenged on whether he would write about Pierre’s business interests Clear enough to sound like a denial  but general enough to allow you to focus most of your energies away from Wall Street Do you at least concede that previously the chief focus of your site was to be on finance and now it’s on politics and “culture” If the  main focus  of the site still on uncovering financial corruption Yes or no If yes  why did your boss mischaracterize the site so badly in his blog post  and if no  why not  Redacted Taibbi quote  Pierre has been interfering with First Look’s editorial plans from the start Every single editorial plan First Look has exists only at Pierre’s pleasure He is your sole funder and he is the one making public statements about how he intends to allocate those resources How is it possible you understand Wall Street so well but don’t understand that  Redacted Taibbi quote  Yes  that is what’s apparent from Omidyar’s statement  Redacted Taibbi quote  I had plenty of information  and printed what I knew  after giving you the opportunity to respond before publication I’d have plenty more information to set the record straight if you’d answer any of the questions above Or better still  stop hiding behind “not for publication ” Why  if you’re being so unfairly maligned  won’t you let any of the above be shared with readers Isn’t the whole basis of First Look to make all the information public and let readers decide Why doesn’t that apply to conversations about First Look and its billionaire owner Which leads me to my last question  Have you  or any first look staffer to the best of your knowledge  signed an NDA or non disparagement contract — either as a standalone or as part of your employment contract s You’re right  this is an enjoyable conversation Now let’s shift it up a gear and get to some real answers Paul

Despite previously saying he was enjoying our conversation  Taibbi stopped responding when I asked him he had signed any kind of contract restricting his freedom to talk openly about First Look When I emailed him earlier today  I asked if he had anything to add to his previous comments He replied  “Just that your story was wrong then and still is ”",0,206
"Jeh Johnson shoots down Duncan Hunter s assertion IS is entering U S  via Mexico Since the U S  began airstrikes in Iraq and Syria against the Islamic State  Republicans have frequently connected the terrorist group to border security in the U S In August  Texas Governor Rick Perry called it a “very real possibility” that fighters from the Islamic State had already crossed into the U S 

On Tuesday night  Representative Duncan Hunter  a Republican from California  took those comments even further Appearing on  On the Record with Greta Van Susteren  Hunter said  “At least ten ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the border in Texas ” When Van Susteren asked how he knew that  Hunter replied  “Because I’ve asked the border patrol  Greta ”



I asked the Department of Homeland Security if Hunter’s comments were true They weren t “The suggestion that individuals who have ties to ISIL have been apprehended at the Southwest border is categorically false  and not supported by any credible intelligence or the facts on the ground ” said DHS spokesperson Marsha Catron “DHS continues to have no credible intelligence to suggest terrorist organizations are actively plotting to cross the southwest border ”

UPDATE  Hunter isn t backing off his comments  claiming they came from a  high level source  at DHS  The Congressman was conveying what he knows—and what he was told  Hunter s spokesperson told The Huffington Post  And as for DHS’ statement  it makes sense that the left hand of DHS doesn’t know what the right hand is doing—it’s been that way for a long time and we don’t expect that to change No surprise there ",0,207

"Hoax Alert  Father O’Neal  Who Has Met God and Thinks She’s a Woman  Is Made Up  Just Like God Herself  Boston   So lately  tongues have been wagging due to a recent story of an elderly priest who died and had a conversation with God  and a female God at that The story has been dancing around on Facebook  Twitter  and Reddit It s also sallied across the seas and made it into the African media and the Indian media The story even made it s way to that holy land of obnoxious religious redneckery known as Texas The story goes something like this 
An old fart  er  I mean Catholic priest  in Massachusetts was officially dead for over 48 minutes before medical staff  miraculously  re started his heart  World News Daily Report says All the while  Father John Micheal O Neal says he went to heaven and met God  who was all motherly and feminine and just happened to be a woman Father O Neal  71  was rushed to the hospital in late January after being hit with a major heart attack  but was declared dead shortly after his arrival He was brought back to life via some sort of newfangled mechanical gadgetry and doctors at Massachusetts General Hospital  used more newfangled mechanical gadgetry to unclog vital arteries to his brain Soon they returned his heart to a normal rhythm Father O Neal woke up less than 48 hours later and recovered perfectly  World News Daily Report says Well  of course I mean  after all  if you re going to have a story about some elderly dude talking to God  you can t really have him die  can you That wouldn t come out in the wash There was much wringing of hands  and Catholic Blogger Bridget Mary Meehan wrote 
 The declarations of the cleric caused quite a stir in the catholic clergy of the archdiocese over the last few days  causing the Archbishop to summon a press conference to try and calm the rumors Despite the disapproval of his superiors  Father O Neal says that he will continue dedicating his life to God and spread the word of the  Holy Mother Then she wonders 
 Why is Cardinal O Malley and the Boston Archdiocese so upset You would think he d be inspired Perhaps  he is afraid that if God is a woman  then  that could put a big crack in the church s stained glass ceiling and open the door to women priests Sure  why not employ more delusional people They re certainly entertaining But why is the good Archbishop bothered Perhaps because Father John Micheal O Neal doesn t exist You see  he s really a nice old man on Shutterstock  who probably wishes he were somewhere else other than the hospital Terrence Donilon  a spokesman for Archbishop Sean P  O Malley says the story is a hoax  We do not have a priest of this name  he told Metro co uk  I believe this could be a hoax story And despite whatever Meehan thinks  it s never been verified that O Malley ever issued a public disavowal of the priest s alleged statements It s just not in the public records  About com reports Perhaps  as this story runs its course  the media will realize it was asleep when it should have been awake You see  World News Daily  makes no bones about the fact that it s a satire site Here s the site s disclaimer

Hoax  Banksy Arrested in London  Story Dupes the Internet Again Elusive graffiti artist Banksy’s cover was blown when he was unceremoniously arrested for vandalism  conspiracy  racketeering and counterfeiting Well that’s what US website the National Report would have you believe The bogus story alleged the infamous street artist was arrested following a raid on his London studio It ‘outs’ him as Paul Horner  a 34 year old born in Liverpool and says he is being held “without” bail  along with four other  unnamed individuals Banksy s publicist Jo Brooks confirmed to the Independent the now viral story is a hoax Indeed the quotes which accompany the piece date back to an identical spoof in February last year  which claimed Banksy had been arrested on the same charges and outed as  yep  Paul Horner So basically the internet is now recycling its own hoaxes Lazy ,0,223
Turkish Leader Says U S  Airdrop Aided ISIS Militants Erdogan argued that the Turkish weapons drop has harmed the fight against ISIS ,0,224
"No  Islamic State Militants Have Not Been Caught by U S  Border Patrol Since the U S  began airstrikes in Iraq and Syria against the Islamic State  Republicans have frequently connected the terrorist group to border security in the U S In August  Texas Governor Rick Perry called it a “very real possibility” that fighters from the Islamic State had already crossed into the U S 

On Tuesday night  Representative Duncan Hunter  a Republican from California  took those comments even further Appearing on  On the Record with Greta Van Susteren  Hunter said  “At least ten ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the border in Texas ” When Van Susteren asked how he knew that  Hunter replied  “Because I’ve asked the border patrol  Greta ”



I asked the Department of Homeland Security if Hunter’s comments were true They weren t “The suggestion that individuals who have ties to ISIL have been apprehended at the Southwest border is categorically false  and not supported by any credible intelligence or the facts on the ground ” said DHS spokesperson Marsha Catron “DHS continues to have no credible intelligence to suggest terrorist organizations are actively plotting to cross the southwest border ”

UPDATE  Hunter isn t backing off his comments  claiming they came from a  high level source  at DHS  The Congressman was conveying what he knows—and what he was told  Hunter s spokesperson told The Huffington Post  And as for DHS’ statement  it makes sense that the left hand of DHS doesn’t know what the right hand is doing—it’s been that way for a long time and we don’t expect that to change No surprise there ",0,225

The Po River and Delta are known for massive wels catfish  but anything bigger than 6 5 feet is considered extremely rare  and this one measured 8 8 feet The U K  Mirror reported that Ferrari’s fish could possibly be the world’s biggest wels catfish caught with a rod and reel  though records of this sort are difficult to confirm The Mirror and NT News reported that the biggest wels catfish ever recorded was a 9 1 footer from the Po Delta  but they differ on its weight—one reporting it as 308 pounds  the other as 317 pounds The method of that catch is uncertain Sportex Italia  Ferrari’s sponsor  called his fish the “world record spinning torpedo ” which might mean it’s a world record for a Torpedo spinning rod made by an Italian manufacturer  though it also simply says it’s a “world record in the spin fishing for catfish ”

Regardless  Ferrari’s fish is one of the biggest wels catfish recorded in recent history After weighing the wels catfish  Dino and Dario Ferrari released the beast back into the Po Delta Photo is from the Sportex Italia Facebook page

The red and white spotted toadstool called Amanita muscaria can cause vivid hallucinations and is known for the unpredictability of its effects

 The old fashioned thing to do was to feed it to the village idiot  then drink his urine because you get all of the high without any of the sickness Titchmarsh jokingly replied   I think I ll forgo that and stick to normal mushrooms The fungus  also known as fly agaric  contains the psychoactive chemicals ibotenic acid and muscimol and they can be found throughout the UK Last night a Palace spokesman was keen to point out the fungus is not served to Royals He said   There are several hundred fungi species in the palace garden  including a small number of naturally occurring fly agaric mushrooms  As the programme explains  they are beneficial to trees  increasing their ability to take in nutrients Last night a Palace spokesman was keen to point out the fungi is not served to Royals Pictured  Queen Elizabeth II meets guests at a garden party at Buckingham Palace in London in June 2014

"No  Banksy Didn t Create That  Charlie Hebdo  Tribute Cartoon  But That Doesn t Mean You Can t Appreciate It There s an illustration being shared on Facebook  Instagram and Twitter that claims to be a tribute created by street artist Banksy in response to the terrorist attack that killed 12 people near the offices of the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in Paris earlier today While the image does have a touching message  it s almost certainly a fake   not created by Banksy Here s the illustration that everyone is sharing 

Mashable is reporting that the image was posted by a  popular  Banksy  account  on Instagram The instagram com banksy Instagram isn t run by Banksy at all  and is actually a fan page that shares street art created by a variety of different artists   rarely with any attribution Search on Facebook  Twitter  and Instagram and you ll see plenty of popular accounts that seem to be official Banksy pages The problem of fake social media accounts is so widespread that Banksy has even posted on his official website to deny he runs any Facebook or Twitter accounts He does  however  have one Instagram account  which was used during his recent trip to New York Facebook was recently forced to remove the verification checkmark for a Facebook page for a Banksy account with millions of Likes after the artists PR representative denied that he had anything to do with it The Instagram account that the pencil illustration originates from is part of a ring of fake social media profiles As well as the fake Instagram and Facebook accounts  the administrators behind the Banksy pages also run a YouTube account that re uploads popular viral videos to capitalize on their popularity Here s an example of a video posted by the fake Banksy YouTube account 

Another clue that points to the image being fake is its file size The image uploaded to the fake Banksy social media posts is pixelated and low resolution Banksy is an artist who makes a living from exhibiting his work  he wouldn t want his work to be displayed in a way that makes it look bad It s tricky to verify new Banksy work Because of Banksy s continued anonymity  and the often confusing similarity to other graffiti artists  many works of art end up mistakenly labeled as created by Banksy A handful of galleries and companies in the UK are  however  experts in his work  meaning that they can verify prints purported to originate from Banksy Nevertheless  given today s tragic events  the sentiment is strong SEE ALSO    Vive la France   Massive Rallies In Paris After Terrorist Attack",0,241

"Michael Phelps’ girlfriend Taylor Lianne Chandler reveals she was raised as a boy Michael Phelps  self proclaimed girlfriend Taylor Lianne Chandler has just made a shocking admission In a post on her Facebook  Chandler is revealing she was actually born a boy  and named David Roy Fitch at birth As a teenager however Chandler went on testosterone blockers and had her name changed and then  in her early twenties  underwent corrective surgery to get rid of her male genitalia Scroll down for videos

Shocker  Michael Phelps  self proclaimed girlfriend Taylor Lianne Chandler  above  has admitted she was born David Roy Fitch  and had both male and female genitalia

In the dark  Chandler said her new man Phelps  above  was not aware of her past  though there s no actual proof that the two were ever an official item

Her choice  Chandler began taking testosterone blockers in her teens  and had corrective surgery in her early twenties to get rid of her male genitalia

Feet in the sand  Chandler has since been a champion for gender rights

Chandler was born a male however in name only  and is actually intersex  meaning she had male genitalia  but no testicles  while also having a uterus and no ovaries As she explains in a Facebook post   I was never a man  never lived as a man No one can say they knew me as a man or produce a photo of me as a man She then adds   There are people that remember me as an androgynous child at times because of what was forced upon me She is also revealing how in love she is with Phelps  and claims the two clicked after meeting on Tinder  Spending time with him was like a teenage love affair  she says  I have never felt so comfortable and accepted in every way as I did with him In costume  Chandler dressed as Wonder Woman for Halloween with a pal

Bad night  Chandler  left  claims she was with Phelps  right  the night he was arrested on suspicion of DUI

I m yelling Tinder  A look at Phelps  alleged Tinder profile  which is how he and Chandler first met

She had previously detailed their first date  to a Baltimore Ravens games  to the National Enquirer  One thing led to the next  and we made love during halftime  she claims in the interview  Later  we had sex again The intimacy with him was amazing It was the first time in my life that someone has made me feel like a true woman She also told the magazine that she never lied to the swimmer about her past  saying it just never came up Famous friends  Chandler cozies up to RuPaul s Drag Race alum Detox

So sweet  Chandler posted this image of Phelps to her account and wrote about how excited she was to see him again

Now however  Chandler thinks Phelps may  leave her  after telling her truth  I am probably going to lose him because he is a brand that his team wants to protect and things since he went to rehab came to my attention that didn’t put him or our relationship in the best light  she says Her Facebook is a shrine to the swimmer  with his photos plastered all over her wall and banner She also seems to repost any and all stories that mention their relationship He s out  Chandler said on her Facebook on Wednesday that Phelps is out of rehab

Still on   Phelps has yet to comment on any of this

Chandler claims she was with Phelps when he was arrested on suspicion of DUI on September 30 in Baltimore  Maryland The swimmer entered rehab just a few days after the incident and completed his program on Wednesday according to Chandler The alleged couple also have a bit of an age gap between them  and Phelps is 29 and Chandler is 41 years old Phelps  the most decorated Olympian of all time with 22 medals  is currently serving a six month suspension from swimming as a result of his DUI Boots for days  Chandler s Facebook page is a shrine to Phelps  with the swimmer s photos everywhere

In her post  Chandler also takes some time to discuss the difficulties she has faced in her life  In my early teens I was medically diagnosed and went on testosterone blockers  at 15 estrogen enhancers My birth certificate was modified along with my name while I was a teenager  prior to any corrective surgery  she explains  I originally changed my name to Paige Victoria Whitney At 16 I legally emancipated from my family I had already left home at 15 At 18 I got in trouble twice  once for a bad check and then a DUI  At 19 I thought it would be smart to blackmail someone into giving me the money for my surgery As soon as I received the money I was arrested and charged with extortion  I spent 30 days in jail because I was too ashamed to tell my family what happened thinking no one knew Even though my birth certificate and drivers license said female they put me in a cell with 3 men and I was raped She has since spent much of her life crusading for gender rights ",0,245

Quoting from Muslim scholars  Munajjid argued that to build a snowman was to create an image of a human being  an action considered sinful under the kingdom’s strict interpretation of Sunni Islam “God has given people space to make whatever they want which does not have a soul  including trees  ships  fruits  buildings and so on ” he wrote in his ruling That provoked swift responses from Twitter users writing in Arabic and identifying themselves with Arab names “They are afraid for their faith of everything   sick minds ” one Twitter user wrote Another posted a photo of a man in formal Arab garb holding the arm of a “snow bride” wearing a bra and lipstick “The reason for the ban is fear of sedition ” he wrote A third said the country was plagued by two types of people  “A people looking for a fatwa  religious ruling  for everything in their lives  and a cleric who wants to interfere in everything in the lives of others through a fatwa ”

Munajjid had some supporters however “It  building snowmen  is imitating the infidels  it promotes lustiness and eroticism ” one wrote “May God preserve the scholars  for they enjoy sharp vision and recognise matters that even Satan does not think about ”

To call the Sugarhill Gang the “big bang” of hip hop diminishes the contributions of an entire community that imagined the music at its inception Big Bank Hank  after all  got his start in the business as a bouncer and managing an act that would become the Cold Crush Brothers He landed a spot in the Sugarhill Gang when the late music executive Sylvia Robinson tapped him to be part of a pop oriented rap trio she was putting together Jeff Chang’s essential history of hip hop  “Can’t Stop  Won’t Stop ” describes the song as standing out amid party oriented rap of the time due to the group’s birth as a studio creation Writes Chang  “Their raps on ‘Rapper’s Delight’ were the stuff that sounded good not in the parties  but on the live bootleg cassettes playing in the OJ cabs and on the boom boxes   the funny stories  the hookish slang  the same kind of stuff that would strike listeners around the world as both universal and new  not local and insular ”

“Rapper’s Delight” is considered the best selling 12 inch single of all time  though that’s tough to confirm in the pre Soundscan era  which began in 1991  and various litigation involving the track’s unapproved sampling of Chic’s “Good Times” further blurred the issue of numbers As happened with most first generation rap teams  and second  third  fourth  and fifth  Sugarhill Gang failed to sustain a bankable post hit career  and didn’t receive royalty checks equal to its influence In the years following the track s success  the style morphed in dozens of different directions  though  becoming politicized through Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five  electro fied through Afrika Bambaataa and popularized through Run DMC and the Beastie Boys Reverse engineer virtually any rap song since  and the circuitry leads back to  Rapper s Delight  and by extension  Big Bank Hank His phrasing  his fluid  funky tone  has endured  passed down from rapper to rapper  an invisible but essential presence Follow Randall Roberts on Twitter   liledit",0,266

"280 Pound Catfish  Fisherman Makes Huge Catch In Italy  Catfish Could Set Record A 280 pound catfish was caught by a fisherman in Italy According to USA Today Sports  Dino Ferrari caught the huge fish in Po Delta While the catfish caught by Ferrari was 8 7 feet in length and weighed 280 pounds  the largest catfish ever caught weighed 300 pounds That does not mean that this wasn’t a record breaking fish  however According to the report  this might be the largest catfish ever caught using a generic fishing rod According to the San Antonio Express News  any catfish over 6 5 feet is considered extremely rare Ferrari isn’t some small time fisherman  either According to Grind TV  the Italy native is a pro at catching big Wels catfish  and many of these fish frequent the waters where Ferrari casts his line “The wels catfish is the second largest freshwater fish in its region  ranking behind the beluga sturgeon The largest beluga sturgeon on record is reportedly 3 463 pounds ”

The 280 pound catfish is certainly a sight to see  as it looks as if it could swallow Ferrari whole He posed for photos with the fish  clearly very proud of his catch  even appearing to hug it while his brother took some pictures  which took him a tiring 40 minutes to reel in It is almost hard to believe that catfish can get that big Animal lovers may be happy to know that Ferrari did not keep the catfish  nor did he sell it for money After his brother took a couple of pictures of the creature  the guys released it back into the river  where it swam off  happy to live another day As previously reported by the Inquisitr  these Wels catfish aren’t exactly harmless  this certainly is not the type of sea creature that you would want to swim into And it is definitely not a “gentle giant” by any means “Dino’s monster catch is not the sort of fish you’d want to accidentally swim into while skinny dipping The fish has a ferocious appetite and will consume anything that happens to cross its path These surly catfish have even been filmed eating pigeons after our feathery friends happened to fly too close to these cold blooded killers ”

"James Foley  American Journalist  James Wright Foley Beheaded in New ISIS Video  Breaking News  American photojournalist James Wright Foley has been beheaded by ISIS forces

Foley has been missing since Thanksgiving 2012 while working in Syria

ISIS posted the extremely graphic video  A Message to America  to social media

Foley speaks to camera before his death and labels the US his killers

Apparently coerced by his captors into speaking against his country

A masked and robed member of ISIS speaking English in what is thought to be a British accent addresses the camera too

After the execution of Foley  the ISIS member says that missing American journalist Steven Joel Sotloff will be killed next

A man identified as Sotloff in a caption on the video is then paraded in front of the camera

Beheading comes one day after ISIS threat to America that  we will drown all you in blood  following the US aided Kurdish recapture of the Mosul Dam

Horrific video of American freelance photo journalist James Wright Foley  40  being beheaded by ISIS in revenge for US airstrikes in Iraq was posted to the internet Tuesday afternoon Foley  has been missing since November  2012  after being taken hostage at gunpoint while reporting from Taftanaz  in northern Syria  for the agency  GlobalPost ISIS posted the extremely graphic video shot at an unknown location  titled  A Message to America  to social media as proof of their barbaric actions In a chilling warning at the end of grisly film  the executioner  who has what sounds like a British accent  paraded another American journalist  Steven Joel Sotloff  who went missing in August 2013  saying   The life of this American citizen  Obama  depends on your next decision The video emerged as President Barack Obama was returning from the White House to his Martha s Vineyard vacation White House National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden says the administration has seen the video She says that if it’s deemed genuine by the intelligence community  the US would be ‘appalled by the brutal murder of an innocent American journalist ’
His family issued a statement through their Free James Foley organization  which has been working to free the journalist  We know that many of you are looking for confirmation or answers Please be patient until we all have more information  and keep the Foleys in your thoughts and prayers As the disturbing video infolds  Foley  dressed in orange and on his knees  is unflinching to the end as he addresses the camera before his death It appears the journalist has been coerced into blaming the United States by his brutal captors His voice strong  but struggling at times to swallow as he battles against fear  he brands the US government his real killers as a man in black robes armed with a gun stands over him Foley who has been missing for almost two years also leaves a haunting message for his brother  John  who is thought to be in the US Air Force Referring to US airstrikes launched nearly two weeks ago in Iraq  Foley says  ‘I died that day  John  when your colleagues dropped that bomb on these people They signed my death certificate’ 
As the appalling video unfolds  Foley blames the  complacency and criminality  of the United States for his impending death In his final  awful message to the world  Foley pleads for more time  to have seen his family who fought for his freedom for two years again In a final insult from his vengeful executioners  Foley is made to deny his birthright as a citizen of the United States  I wish I had more time  I wish I could have the hope of freedom and see my family once again  but that ship has sailed I guess all in all  I wish I wasn’t American  says Foley before his tragic death The reporter then stops speaking and his executioner steps forward The masked  armed and black robe clad man speaks in English in what is thought to be a British accent Members of the UK s Associated Press pegged the accent to the South East of England and London  while others have claimed the accent resembles one from North Africa ‘This is James Wright Foley  an American citizen of your country As a government you have been at the forefront of the aggression towards the Islamic State  begins the executioner  You have plotted against us and gone far out of your way to find reasons to interfere in our affairs Today  your military airforce is attacking us daily in Iraq  Your strikes have caused casualties amongst Muslims You are no longer fighting an insurgency  We are an Islamic Army and a state that has been accepted by a large number of Muslims worldwide  So effectively  any aggression toward the Islamic State is aggression towards Muslims from all walks of life who have accepted the Islamic Caliphate as their leadership  So any attempt by you  Obama  to deny the Muslims their rights of living in safety under the Islamic Caliphate will result in the bloodshed of your people ’

At this point the executioner beheads Foley  who is kneeling bravely with hands tied behind his back His body is displayed with the head atop the body Then in another chilling warning  the executioner holds another man  on his kness with his hands tied behind his back  by the scruff of the neck A caption claims it is Steven Joel Soltoff The executioner says  ‘The life of this American citizen  Obama  depends on your next decision ’
GlobalPost s co founder  Charles Sennott told ABC News that there is  no reliable proof that this execution is authentic  If the video is verified  it is just unfathomable darkness to think that a life as bright as Jim Foley s ended that way  Sennott said  He was an experienced and fearless journalist who believed deeply in reporting from the frontlines The gruesome video clip opens with President Obama announcing the commencement of American air strikes on Iraq against ISIS  Today I authorized two operations in Iraq  targeted airstrikes to protect our American personnel  and a humanitarian effort to help save thousands of Iraqi civilians who are trapped on a mountain without food and water  and facing almost certain death  says Obama in a statement dated  August 7 ISIS  which has claimed control of most of northern Iraq and parts of Syria is threatening to kill Time journalist Joel Sotloff next unless President Obama ceases attacks on the terror group Sotloff has been missing since the middle of 2013 and last tweeted on August 3rd  2013 According to his Twitter account he was in Libya at the time of his disappearance Foley’s family including parents John and Diane  of Rochester  New Hampshire  have publicly appealed for their son’s release over the past two years Foley was previously held captive by pro Gaddafi forces in Libya The barbaric beheading comes one day after ISIS militants threatened to attack U S  targets  in any place  in a chilling video showing a blood spattered Star and Stripes next to the jihadist flag with the message in English   We will drown all of you in blood Unlike Al Qaeda  the Islamic State has so far focused on seizing land in Iraq and Syria for its self proclaimed caliphate  not spectacular attacks on Western targets It came as President Barack Obama on Monday announced that Kurdish peshmerga troops  supported by U S  jets  had recaptured the strategically important Mosul Dam  hailing the offensive as a  major step forward The dam had given the militants control over power and water supplies  and any breach of the vulnerable structure would have threatened thousands of lives As the U S  military strikes the Islamic State group in Iraq  Syrian President Bashar Assad s forces also stepped up their own campaign against militant strongholds in Syria Foley  who lived Boston  was previously held captive by pro Gaddafi forces for six weeks in Libya in 2011 He was released after 45 days following an international campaign by his friends and family The Foley family from Rochester  New Hampshire  had hoped keeping silent could aid his release from Syria  but early last year decided to appeal directly to his kidnappers  increasingly concerned as they grew increasingly concerned  We want Jim to come safely home  or at least we need to speak with him to know he s okay  his father John Foley said in a statement in January 2013 as the Foley family launched a website to publicize his disappearance   Jim is an objective journalist and we appeal for the release of Jim unharmed To the people who have Jim  please contact us so we can work together toward his release James  or Jim as he is known to his family and friends  is one of five children to parents John and Diane Foley Foley  who studied at Marquette University  Milwaukee  and later studied journalism at Northwestern University  Chicago  has also reported on the war in Iraq and Afghanistan Prior to a career in journalism  he taught reading and writing skills to convicted felons at Cook County Jail in Chicago ",0,282
"Nasa questions whether crater in Nicaragua caused by meteorite We reported on Monday that a meteor  thought possibly to be a chunk of an Earth passing asteroid  was the cause of a 40 foot crater outside the international airport in the Nicaraguan capital But astronomers and NASA scientists are now casting doubt on that possibility The biggest mystery is that no one so far has reported seeing a flash of light in the sky that would be expected to accompany such a meteor strike  While a meteoritic origin for this crater cannot be ruled out with absolute certainty  the information available at this time suggests that some other cause is responsible for its creation  NASA s blog concludes Space com reports

"North Korea denies reports Kim Jong un is to open state backed restaurant in Scotland  It s a nonsense  says official

North Korea has moved to deny reports its leader Kim Jong un is planning to open a restaurant in Scotland The dictator presides over a chain of restaurants known as “Pyongyang”  with international branches already including Amsterdam  and a number of North Korea experts had speculated that Scotland would be a natural target for expansion Kim was reported to have taken a keen interest in Scottish affairs during the referendum debate in September  when officials claimed he felt a vote for independence “would be a very positive thing” It has also been noted that Scotch whisky is a favourite tipple among the North Korean elite  while tourists can be asked to make gifts of the drink to tour guides and hosts instead of cash Michael Madden  editor of the North Korea Leadership Watch blog  told the Scotsman it “would not surprise me at all if they opted to open a restaurant in Scotland”  while the UK Korea Institute’s Jenny Town told the Mirror Kim would support “any country struggling for independence and legitimacy” But speaking to The Independent  an official at the North Korean embassy said of the reports  “It’s a nonsense ” He declined to comment further Mr Madden said the Pyongyang restaurants have been around for about 10 years  and that a significant proportion of their takings is funnelled back to government coffers He said they were one of the very few ways the majority of people can experience North Korean culture without making a trip to the secretive state “But they tailor the menus to suit ” he added “Customers in Western Europe won’t get a plateful of dog ”",0,284

Vet Faye Bethell used tiny instruments to remove one lump close to the fish’s anus  and another from its dorsal fin The fish lover had taken the sick  three inch pet for a consultation at North Walsham’s Toll Barn Veterinary Centre  according to Miss Bethell  29 At first he had baulked at the price quoted for the treatment and went away But he had returned five minutes later and asked for it to go ahead Goldfish  which can be bought for less than £3 each  can live up to 10 years The ailing fish  which has made a full recovery  was two years and 10 months old at the time of its operation Fishy facts
■ Goldfish  which can be bought for less than £3 each  can live up to 10 years ■ Goldfish have a memory span of at least three months ■ Goldfish can grow more than a foot long  but can be stunted by being kept in tanks too small for them and where the water quality is poor ■ Goldfish have no eyelids  so they have to sleep with their eyes open ■ Goldfish have been kept as pets for more than 2 000 years ■ The collective noun for goldfish is a “glint” or a “troubling” The delicate procedure  which lasted about 50 minutes  involved introducing a carefully measured anaesthetising agent into the fish’s water As it lost its balance  it was removed from its tank and placed on a waterproof drape The anaesthetic water was then introduced into its mouth via a tube and bubbled over its gills  through which it breathes Using a miniature heart rate monitor  Miss Bethell checked that the fish was properly “under” before using a mini scalpel to remove the lumps She then sewed each cut with three stitches  finally using a special “glue” to cover and waterproof the fish’s scales before it was gradually re awakened Working with some weird and wonderful creatures
Taking lumps off goldfish is all in a day’s work for vet Faye Bethell  who spent one morning this week castrating a skunk Cadbury  the chocolate skunk  had been brought in for the snip by his Scratby Garden Centre owners Since opening Toll Barn vets’ a year ago  specialising in exotics  Miss Bethell has performed a varied range of operations They include

" Jihadi John  Isis fighter named as Mohammed Emwazi from west London The Islamic State executioner known as  Jihadi John  was today revealed to be a university graduate from London who flew to Syria despite being on an MI5 terror watch list Mohammed Emwazi  27  of Queen’s Park  west London  who studied computer programming at the University of Westminster  is said to have travelled to the Middle East in 2012 and later joined ISIS Jihadi John has featured in the horrifying execution videos of U S  journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff  aid worker David Haines  22 Syrian soldiers and Japanese reporter Kenji Goto Scroll down for video

Unmasked  The ISIS executioner  Jihadi John  has been identified as Mohammed Emwazi from west London

Arabic speaker Mr Emwazi  who first moved to Britain aged six  was reported to have been raised in a middle class family and occasionally prayed at a mosque in Greenwich  south east London But after graduating from university in 2009  he claimed to have been harassed and intimidated by the security services   and even complained to the Independent Police Complaints Commission Mr Emwazi alleged an agent from MI5 knew ‘everything about me  where I lived  what I did  and the people I hanged around with’ and claimed the organisation attempted to ‘turn’ him to work for them One of Kuwait born Mr Emwazi’s close friends identified him  telling a newspaper  ‘I have no doubt that Mohammed is Jihadi John He was like a brother to me… I am sure it is him ’

And Asim Qureshi  research director a British human rights group Cage   who had been in contact with Mr Emwazi before he left for Syria   said he also believed the man was Jihadi John Mr Qureshi told the Washington Post  ‘There was an extremely strong resemblance This is making me feel fairly certain that this is the same person Home  Mr Emwazi’s most recent address was a flat in Leeve House  above  which is part of the Mozart Estate in Queen s Park   an area that has seen shootings and gang related troubles in the past four years

According to the newspaper  in May 2009 Mr Emwazi flew to Tanzania with friends apparently on a safari   but was arrested by police upon landing in Dar es Salaam and sent back to Britain En route he stopped in Amsterdam  where he claimed to have been accused by an MI5 officer of trying to reach Somalia  home of the militant group Al Shabaab The Washington Post reported Mr Emwazi   who has also been known as Muhammad ibn Muazzam   then moved to his native Kuwait and worked in IT  but he was detained by counter terrorism police in June 2010 upon a return trip to London They allegedly fingerprinted him and searched his belongings  and he was not allowed to fly back to Kuwait Mr Emwazi was put on a terror watch list and banned from leaving the UK The FBI said last September that authorities had been trying to identify Jihadi John using various investigative techniques including voice analysis and interviews with former hostages Scotland Yard would not confirm the name  and Downing Street declined to comment on the report Mr Emazi’s most recent address was a flat in Leeve House  part of the Mozart Estate in Queen s Park   an area that has seen shootings and gang related troubles in the past four years A spokesman for the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation at King s College London said  ‘We believe that the identity and name published by the Washington Post and now in the public realm to be accurate and correct ‘“Jihadi John” is not special  in the sense that all the foreign fighters have tried to hide their identity by using pseudonyms or literally by masking themselves ‘The fact that “Jihadi John” has been unveiled in this manner demonstrates that whatever efforts are made  the ability to mask one s identity is limited or in fact impossible  and their true identities will eventually be revealed ’

In September  it was revealed Jihadi John was known to MI5 before he travelled to Syria to join ISIS It was revealed security officials had identified him but his name and background were being kept secret to avoid jeopardising any hostage rescue missions Horrifying  Jihadi John has featured in the execution videos of American journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff  aid worker David Haines  22 Syrian soldiers and Japanese journalist Kenji Goto  pictured 

Police and security agents said they also wanted to gather more information before raiding the homes of the fanatic’s family and friends Not him  Abdel Majed Abdel Bary   a London rapper initially identified as a suspect   was ruled out

Abdel Majed Abdel Bary – a London rapper initially identified as a suspect – was ruled out after analysis of his voice as well as his height and mannerisms The 23 year old came to prominence last year after he posted a photograph of himself on Twitter holding up a severed head Other Britons from Portsmouth  Birmingham and Cardiff have been linked to John  who is said to have overseen the torture of hostages and to have led negotiations for French and Italian captives freed in return for ransoms It is claimed he was making street collections for genuine Arab charities based in London at the time he came to MI5’s attention There is no suggestion that MI5 or the police had any basis to stop him from travelling abroad David Cameron has repeatedly called for the infamous terrorist to be punished for his crimes In an interview with MailOnline last month  the Prime Minister revealed how he personally watched videos of the brutal beheadings of British hostages carried out by Jihadi John  These videos are absolutely horrific and depraved  the Prime Minister said  And obviously I take the time to see what they are doing so I understand what families have been going through Speaking in November  Mr Cameron said  ‘You should be in no doubt that I want Jihadi John to face justice for the appalling acts that have been carried out in Syria ’

Briton named as Jihadi John claimed he was repeatedly approached by MI5 to become an informant and believed he was being harassed by agents

MI5 repeatedly tried to recruit Mohammed Emwazi as an informant and put him on a terror watchlist to stop him leaving Britain but he still managed to flee the country for Syria  it was claimed today Mr Emwazi is believed to have become known to the security services in 2009 when he was accused of trying to fight with Somali terror group Al Shabaab in east Africa The British citizen  who was born in Kuwait and moved to the UK aged six  flew to Tanzania with two friends after he graduated from the University of Westminster claiming he was going on safari But he was arrested as soon as he touched down in capital Dar es Salaam and deported by Tanzanian s officials He flew back to Britain via Amsterdam and told a friend MI5 were waiting for him at Schiphol Airport and tried to recruit him to share information on extremists  Mr Emwazi told a confidant Asim Qureshi  research director at the rights group Cage told the Washington Post   Mohammed was quite incensed by his treatment  that he had been very unfairly treated Mr Emwazi claimed in emails that he was repeatedly approached by the security services over the course of the following year but he said he refused to co operate and denied he had any links to terrorism Hostages who have survived being held by ISIS in Syria and Iraq have said that Jihadi John is a man  obsessed  with Somalia and would make them watch Al Shabaab videos while in captivity In June 2010 counter terrorism officers  linked to the security services and Scotland Yard  allegedly arrested him as he tried to fly to Kuwait He was fingerprinted and searched  it was said  and put on a terror watchlist preventing him from leaving Britain In an email to Mr Qureshi he said   I feel like a prisoner  only not in a cage  in London A person imprisoned   controlled by security service men  stopping me from living my new life in my birthplace   country  Kuwait Another friend said  ‘He was upset and wanted to start a life elsewhere He at some stage reached the point where he was really just trying to find another way to get out ’

Another friend said that Emwazi later tried to travel to Saudi Arabia to teach English in 2012 but again stopped from leaving He was  desperate  to leave Britain and  was ready to exhaust every single kind of avenue within the machinery of the state to bring a change for his personal situation  Mr Qureshi said Mr Qureshi said he last heard from him that year and said the Jihadi John supect believed  actions were taken to criminalize him and he had no way to do something against these actions Soon afterwards he vanished and is believed to have travelled to Syria  where he may now be ISIS  figurehead The University of Westminster was one of the 21 university institutions which have been found to promote gender segregation Research by Student Rights  a group which aims to prevent extremism at universities  said that from September to March 2013  46 events at 21 separate institutions were found to have been segregated At the University of Westminster  at least two events were found to have been advertised as ‘women only’ The research found that on March 21  2013 a debate entitled ‘Secularism vs  Islam’ was held by the Women’s Take on Current Affairs Society  WTCA  a Hizb ut Tahrir front group  and featured Shohana Khan as a speaker When challenged by students as to why the WTCA was able to hold events segregated by gender  the Student Union Interfaith Officer allegedly claimed that the society’s events were ‘faith based’  which exempted it from equal opportunities policy In addition to this  an event the following day was held by the Islamic Society called ‘The Concept of Love in Islam’ which was also advertised as ‘Sisters only’ It was logged by Student Rights for this reason Student Rights said that when a male student from the society complained about not being able to attend  the Islamic Society highlighted that segregated events were common on campus stating ‘we’ve had many brothers only events too the information discussed in the only women talks or notes can be put to the public after the talk the topics at hand do not only concern women ’

The University of Westminster’s ‘Dignity and Diversity at Work and Study Policy’ states that  ‘The University of Westminster is committed to creating a stimulating  supportive  inclusive and accessible learning and working environment The University has a legal responsibility to provide a healthy and safe working environment that is free from unlawful discrimination and harassment ’",0,286

"That ESPN Domestic Violence Panel You Keep Hearing About Isn t Real On Friday  Esquire com s Ben Collins wrote a blog post in which some awkward phrasing made it appear as though tonight s episode of Monday Night Countdown on ESPN will feature a special panel discussion on domestic violence Here s how his post starts 

On Monday night  a panel on a two hour pregame show for Monday Night Football will  among other things  address domestic abuse This panel will discuss  once again  the appropriate penalty for hitting a woman The panel for that discussion will include the following people  Chris Berman  Cris Carter  Mike Ditka  Adam Schefter  Tom Jackson  Keyshawn Johnson  Jon Gruden  Mike Tirico  Stuart Scott  Steve Young and Ray Lewis Up to 11 men  all between the ages of 39 and 74 will sit at the table for a domestic violence discussion on ESPN Zero women Victims of domestic violence in America are most likely to be women aged 20 24 When the show has updates from the field—brief reports about injuries and the upcoming game—they ll cut to female sideline reporters  Lisa Salters and  on some weeks  Suzy Kolber These people are not allowed at the table Collins s outrage at ESPN s failure to include any women in a discussion dedicated to domestic violence was shared by many  and word of the  panel discussion  began to spread across Twitter 









And then there were a lot of other blogposts  piggybacking off of Collins s  with headlines like these 

ESPN Doesn t Get It  They Ignore Women s Voices In Public Dialog About Domestic Violence
ESPN s Domestic Violence Panel Is Missing Something Important
11 Men and 0 Women on Tonight s ESPN Domestic Violence Panel

UltraViolet Calls on ESPN to Include Women in Discussion About Domestic Violence

Statement from Nita Chaudhary  co founder of UltraViolet  on ESPN s announcement that a 11 man panel will discuss domestic violence during their Monday Night Football pre game roundtable 

 By having a roundtable on domestic violence and not including any women  much less survivors of domestic violence  the panel is the height of ignorance by ESPN ESPN must be getting their PR advice from their buddies at the NFL Both the NFL and ESPN seem to greatly misunderstand the problem they are trying to address and the millions of people s lives it effects While it s good to see ESPN taking on the issue of domestic violence within the NFL tonight  we strongly believe that they should also include the voices of women and survivors of domestic violence at the table With nearly 45  of NFL fans and viewers being women  including women at the table not only would add to the discussion but would address the realities of their audience and the issue at hand But tonight s episode of Monday Night Countdown is just going to be a regular episode  and will not be featuring any special discussion about domestic violence We reached out to ESPN PR  who told us that talk of the special panel was  false info  and that tonight will feature a  regular episode of Countdown hosted by Suzy Kolber There are certainly criticisms to be made of Monday Night Countdown fielding such a dude heavy panel that is painfully ill equipped to speak intelligently about any issue of substance  as has been proven in the past Tonight  however  it s highly unlikely that domestic violence will even come up Update  And here is a statement from ESPN 

Contrary to published reports in Esquire  there was no panel on domestic violence ever planned for tonight s Monday Night Countdown We will present our normal Monday Night Football pre game show  with Suzy Kolber hosting and Lisa Salters reporting ESPN is proud of the work it has done covering the issue of domestic violence  and is committed to continued coverage Much of that work has been informed by several talented female colleagues from our television and espnW platforms  including Hannah Storm  Jemele Hill  Jane McManus  Kate Fagan  Sarah Spain and more ",0,299

Seven High School Girls Get Pregnant On Five Day School Trip  Parents Outraged BANJA LUKA  – Primary school students from a small town in Bosnia and Herzegovina went to a five day excursion  and after some time it turned out that seven schoolgirls got pregnant on it National Coordinator for Reproductive Health of the Republika Srpska Nenad Babici said that children engage in sexual relations as early as at age of 13 or 14 and added that primary school students from a small town in Bosnia and Herzegovina went to a five day trip  and after some time it turned out that seven schoolgirls got pregnant on it He said that the reason for this was neglect of parents  but also educational institutions  toward the education of children Babic said that early engagement in sexual relations later leads to a series of consequences such as infertility  various diseases  miscarriages and premature births “In the Republika Srpska between 15 to 18 percent of people are struggling with infertility  we have 15 percent of miscarriages and between 5 to 10 percent premature births ” he said Only last year  according to the Clinical Center of the University in Sarajevo  31 minors gave birth  four of them are 15 years old  ten are 16 years old and 17 are 17 years old The problem of adolescent in Bosnia and Herzegovina is becoming more prominent  but information on the increasing number of sexually active girls aged between 13 and 15 years of age is also shocking Thus  on a website where girls seek advice from experts  gynecologists  peers  one of them wrote ”I would have sex with my boyfriend  even though I’m only 14… But I am afraid I’ll be judged ” The page also contains information according to which boys engage in sexual relations at age of 11  writes “Dnevni Avaz” Sarajevo gynecologist Senad Mehmedbasic says that it is terrible that girls aged 13 or 16 engage in sexual relations  but adds that this is something that  unfortunately  is in the trend He warns that in these cases both pregnancy and child birth are highly risky “It is obvious that children do not have enough of health education so they engage in such activities  not knowing the consequences We have to be more direct in the educational system  it must not be allowed that street teaches children about intimate matters  and that they are later slapped by life ” he said ,0,315
"Magic mushrooms found in BUCKINGHAM PALACE by Alan Titchmarsh The fungi was found by TV gardener Alan Titchmarsh

A hallucinogenic toadstool mushroom is growing in the gardens of Buckingham Palace The red and white spotted Amanita muscaria species   also known as fly agaric   has been discovered by Alan Titchmarsh while on tour of the grounds with ecology expert Professor Mick Crawley The discovery of the mushroom   which is likely to have grown on the 40 acre land without being specifically cultivated   was recorded during a 12 month study for ITV show The Queen s Garden  which is to be aired on Christmas Day Mr Titchmarsh asks Professor Crawley if the fungi is edible  to which he replies  “That depends what you mean It’s eaten in some cultures for its hallucinogenic effects But it also makes people who eat it very sick “The old fashioned thing to do was feed it to the village idiot  then drink his urine because you get all the high without any of the sickness ”

Mr Titchmarsh  known for presenting BBC gardening programme Ground Force and the annual RHS Chelsea Flower Show  then says  “I think I’ll forgo that and stick to some normal mushrooms” “Not something to try at home ” he added Chemicals muscimol and ibotenic acid found in the fungi cause psychoactive effects such as drowsiness  hallucinations  mood changes  euphoria and disassociation The plant has a long history of religious and shamanic use dating back around 10 000 years However  unlike psilocybin mushrooms   which were reclassified to Class A in 2006 and have been more popular for recreational use   the legal status of selling fly agaric in the UK remains complicated Possession is not illegal The physical effects are described as  undesirable  and the chemicals can carry risks of poisoning and death  according to drug advice charity Talk to Frank The mushrooms are culturally depicted in Lewis Carroll s Alice in Wonderland  Nintendo s Super Mario Brothers video games and in Disney s musical production Fantasia ",0,316
"Michael Phelps’ ‘girlfriend’ reveals she was born a man – and never told the swimmer Taylor Lianne Chandler  a woman who claims to be Michael Phelps  girlfriend  has revealed that she was born intersex and was given the name David Roy Fitch at birth As per the Intersex Society of North America  intersex is 

A general term used for a variety of conditions in which a person is born with a reproductive or sexual anatomy that doesn’t seem to fit the typical definitions of female or male For example  a person might be born appearing to be female on the outside  but having mostly male typical anatomy on the inside Or a person may be born with genitals that seem to be in between the usual male and female types Chandler  41  wrote a lengthy Facebook post outlining her journey but admits that she has never told some people  including Phelps  about her past She writes  

By the time I could walk and talk I made it clear I was a girl and dressed as one In my early teens I was medically diagnosed and went on testosterone blockers  at 15 estrogen enhancers My birth certificate was modified along with my name while I was a teenager  prior to any corrective surgery  

The problem is I have made friends that I never told and dated and married people that knew nothing of my past If you don’t understand what intersex is  Google it I was never a man  never lived as a man No one can say they knew me as a man or produce a photo of me as a man Eighteen time Olympic gold medalist Phelps spent most of October in a rehab centre after being arrested for driving under the influence in September Chandler says she met Phelps on the dating app Tinder and described their relationship as being  like a teenage love affair However  she admitted concern in her post that Phelps would end their relationship  

I am probably going to lose him because he is a brand that his team wants to protect and things since he went to rehab came to my attention that didn’t put him or our relationship in the best light He is the first man I ever had intimacy with and felt comfortable and all woman When he went to rehab I had to go through all this scrutiny and tabloid mess by myself His team at Octagon abandoned me  whether he knows that or not I do not know Chandler wrote her Facebook post on November 13th  but it has only now been widely picked up by media outlets such as the Daily Mail and Daily Mirror On Wednesday  she wrote   Heard from Michael he is out of rehab and back home  while also expressing frustration about how her story is being reported Two steps forward and 100 steps backwards That is what life feels like to me right now In a world of educated people that had all the facts of intersex and what it means and then to sell a magazine say Michael Phelps is dating a MAN I have cried now for an hour  thrown up anything in my system till I dry heaved I just can t believe this is happening in 2014 ",0,317

"Obama  Outraged Over Beheading  Vows to Stay on Course President Barack Obama denounced Islamic State  Isis  militants for murdering an American journalist in retaliation for US air strikes in Iraq  showing an anger he has rarely displayed in remarks about the Iraq conflict “No just god would stand for what they did yesterday and every single day ” Obama said Wednesday in brief remarks from Edgerton  Massachusetts  where he is vacationing Hours after US intelligence authenticated a gruesome Isis videotape showing the execution of captive journalist James Foley  an act committed with the goal of deterring future US strikes on Isis  Obama said that Isis “has no place in the 21st century ” and called on allies to help defeat a “cancer so it does not spread ”

Obama did not announce any intensification of his bombing campaign  now in its thirteenth day US Central Command has yet to announce any new strikes since the Tuesday appearance of the social media borne Foley video  although sporadic reports from Iraq have indicated some may have taken place Wednesday An emotional Obama ran through a litany of Isis human rights abuses  from rape to enslavement  calling them “cowardly acts of violence ” In a vague reference to Americans held captive by Isis or near its path in Iraq  Obama said the US would “do everything we can to protect our people ” a formulation that has preceded US military action in the past With the death of the first American in Iraq since the US military withdrew in 2011  pressure is mounting on Obama to expand his already growing and amorphous air war against Isis The stated purpose of nearly two weeks of bombing has moved from the rescue of mostly Yazidi Iraqi civilians at risk of genocide to providing air cover for Kurdish and Iraqi forces wresting the strategically vital Mosul Dam away from Isis Aides to Obama pointed out from the start that threats to critical infrastructure would likely prompt a US reprisal Buffeted between calls to destroy Isis and criticism of their shifting rationale  Obama and the Pentagon have strenuously objected to a charge of mission creep They point out the consistency of the goals Obama has articulated since 8 August  preventing humanitarian catastrophe and protecting US personnel in Iraq Yet both are broad enough to encompass aerial protection of Iraqi Kurdistan and the destruction of Isis vehicles  artillery and fixed positions from Mount Sinjar to the Mosul Dam The murder of Foley – delivered after he gave a statement at knifepoint blaming the US for his death – and Isis’s threat to kill another American journalist  Steven Sotloff  is also testing Obama’s goal of safeguarding US nationals in a country overrun by Isis National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said Wednesday that the video showed both Foley and Sotloff Leaders from the UK  France and other countries lined up to excoriate Isis for the slaying British prime minister David Cameron called it “shocking” and cut short his summer holiday to chair meetings on a response A particularly acute concern for the UK government is the British accent heard from Foley’s masked killer US intelligence believes hundreds of westerners  including Americans  have joined Isis In the UK  Scotland Yard’s counter terrorism command  SO15  launched an investigation into the video as leading linguistics experts said the man sounded like he was from London or the south east of England The British foreign secretary  Philip Hammond  said of the video  “All the hallmarks point to it being genuine We’re very concerned by the apparent fact that the murderer in question is British and we are urgently investigating – agencies on both sides of the Atlantic – are first of all looking to authenticate the video  to make sure that it is genuine  and sadly it appears to be  and then to see if we can identify the individual in question ”

A spokesman for German chancellor Angela Merkel called Foley’s murder barbaric Laurent Fabius  the French foreign minister  said it exposed Isis as the “caliphate of barbarism” French president Francois Hollande told Le Monde that a global effort “beyond the traditional debate of intervention or non intervention” was necessary to confront Isis  and proposed an international meeting next month With a brutality so severe it prompted al Qaida to divorce it from the terrorist franchise  Isis has fulfilled a jihadist aspiration to carve out a state It flies a flag  sets up internal police to govern its subjects’ adherence to its interpretation of Islamic laws and customs  and maintains financial viability through the control of seized oil assets While other jihadist entities employ terrorist and insurgent tactics  for which infiltration of another’s populace is central  Isis has mustered a highly mobile army that seizes and holds territory Foley’s killer emphasized in a propaganda video that Isis is a state  not a terrorist group  a distinction that is fundamental to the group’s prestige On Wednesday  Obama repeatedly called Isis “terrorists ”

The Committee to Protect Journalists said the murder of Foley  40  who went missing during a reporting trip to Syria in 2012  “sickens all decent people” “Foley went to Syria to show the plight of the Syrian people  to bear witness to their fight  and in so doing to fight for press freedom ” Sandra Mims Rowe  the group’s chair  said in a statement In a Facebook message attributed to her  Foley’s mother Diane said  “We have never been prouder of our son Jim He gave his life trying to expose the world to the suffering of the Syrian people ” She also asked the media and the public to respect her family’s privacy Obama hailed Foley  who he called Jim  and said he had called Foley’s parents Foley’s murder  Obama said  was “an act of violence that shocks the conscience of the entire world ”",0,328

"No  a mechanical polar bear is not about to be given an Asbo Central Bedfordshire Council has refuted newspaper reports which suggested it was about to issue an Anti Social Behaviour Order  Asbo  to a six foot mechanical bear The polar bear  named Bernard  is situated outside the Loft Cafe in Shefford and performs Christmas carols to passers by but a story in the Bedfordshire on Sunday newspaper suggested residents feared it “could be hit with an Asbo after receiving complaints” However  a press officer for the council told i100 co uk that the story was “embellished” and there had been “absolutely no mention of an Asbo or a gagging order  or anything like that” The council did acknowledge that one noise complaint had been made about the bear and council officers were therefore “legally obliged” to investigate it but subsequently deemed it not to be a nuisance We have received one complaint regards a Christmas carol singing bear and have visited the premises on a number of occasions and  while Bernard has not been deemed a nuisance  we have written to both parties  explaining the situation as part of an ongoing investigation The council takes noise complaints seriously and has a legal obligation to fully investigate them  but we also want everyone in Central Bedfordshire to enjoy themselves over the Christmas period and would urge residents and business owners alike to be mindful of their neighbours and the local community when planning festivities Central Bedfordshire Council statement
The story in the Bedfordshire on Sunday  which was picked up by the Metro and the BBC  has subsequently been updated with a small disclaimer at the end saying  “Central Bedfordshire Council would like to make clear no ABSO proceedings have been brought against Bernard nor has he officially been ‘gagged’ ”

Government guidelines say that anyone over the age of 10 can be given an Asbo for “drunken or threatening behaviour  vandalism and graffiti and playing loud music at night” Sadly  it makes no mention of mechanical polar bears or any other inanimate objects for that matter ",0,340

According to investigators  long time employee Philip Canseco was seen vomiting in the facilities restroom three days prior to the incident on Friday “I was passing by the restroom  when I heard somebody throwing up inside ” said one Texas Prime Turkey Farm employee “I opened the door and looked inside and saw Canseco throwing up in one of the urinals I asked him if he was okay  he said yes  and I left I didn’t want to get close to him and get sick ”

Management confirmed that Canseco worked three full work days at the facility with flu like symptoms  before passing out unconscious with a fever of 106° Due to his symptoms  he was rushed to a local hazmat tent where he tested positive for the Ebola virus The CDC reports an additional 7 coworkers are being quarantined and tested However  they have not released those results as of yet The facility has been ordered by the CDC to burn their entire flock of turkeys  over 250 000 Texas Prime Turkey Farm is requesting permission from the state of Texas to send the shipment of incinerated turkey ashes to Veolia’s Port Arthur environmental waste facility This facility has already accepted one shipment of Ebola waste from household goods where Thomas Eric Duncan had stayed Duncan was the first man to die of  Ebola on US soil Activists are protesting the shipments of contaminated Ebola waste to their community “We feel every precaution should be taken to protect our community  our children and our elderly We are not a dumping ground for the nations  or the world’s bio waste ”

"Zack Snyder’s ‘Batman V Superman  Dawn Of Justice’ Stolen Batmobile Rumor Put To Rest In case you hadn’t heard  a little movie called Batman v Superman  Dawn of Justice is currently filming in and around Detroit  MI Since we live in the Golden Age of social media networking  set pictures and videos have fueled all kinds of speculation on what’s going on in this movie  from Ben Affleck’s shoulder injury to Jesse Eisenberg’s hair to Scoot McNairy’s legs The most recent set leaks revolved around Batman’s ride Instagram users posted several pictures of the new  updated Batmobile  which was promptly followed by an official photo released by director Zack Snyder The exciting design appears to be something of a hybrid between the tank like vehicle used in Christopher Nolan’s Bat films and more traditional  hot rod inspired Batmobiles of old Meanwhile  outlets like Bleeding Cool reported a rumor that one of the Batmobiles from the movie’s set had been stolen The rumor was picked up by some of the mainstream media  such as the local Detroit CBS affiliate  before being debunked by the Detroit Free Press In response  director Zack Snyder took to Twitter  as he does  to send up not only the stolen Batmobile rumor  but to reference a competing franchise Snyder tweeted the following picture 
Is Snyder taking a sly  friendly dig at J J  Abrams and the currently filming Star Wars  Episode VII It would seem so  but what if Snyder had used  say  a Joker or Two Face lookalike – or at least one of their henchmen The internet would’ve imploded This way  Snyder provides fans with a harmless bit of franchise crossover in the form of this officially sanctioned bit of fan fiction The attention to detail is pretty funny  too – the way the Gotham PD cop nearest the Batmobile is looking at the Stormtrooper’s blaster is priceless Make no mistake  Zack Snyder is following the online fan chatter He’s not above calling in to a Detroit radio show to defend Aquaman’s badassery and  apparently  will comment on your Instagram video when the mood takes him CBM caught Snyder’s now deleted comment   “Watching you”   on the following video taken by IG user  danielblane  who was home one night while the Batmobile did burnouts on the neighboring Batman v Superman set 
Snyder  whose Instagram handle is  cruelfilms  has removed his comment  but judging by the reaction of the video’s other commenters  the fact that Snyder has weighed in at all delights them to no end The fact that the director takes the time to interact with his fans is genuinely heartening for audience members who may have questioned the decision to hand Snyder not just an all new Superman and Batman  but Warner Bros  and DC’s own interconnected movie universe The leaked BvS set pictures and videos still don’t answer any of the bigger questions about the film’s plot and whether or not it will be able to seamlessly integrate multiple superheroes while giving us a satisfying first time team up of the World’s Finest  but that won’t stop us from poring over every image from Detroit that we can get our hands on Batman v Superman  Dawn of Justice will open in theaters on March 25  2016 Source  Instagram  Zack Snyder  Bleeding Cool",0,364

Murren didn’t identify the person who ran up the six figure bill  but Bloomberg reporters quickly connected the dinner to Smith  who at the time of the meal was in the midst of a hot run at the blackjack tables  which was apparently witnessed by the late New York Times media columnist David Carr

"Mohammed Emwazi  Man identified as Isis killer  Jihadi John  was  stopped by MI5  while on safari holiday in Africa in 2010 The Islamic State executioner known as  Jihadi John  was today revealed to be a university graduate from London who flew to Syria despite being on an MI5 terror watch list Mohammed Emwazi  27  of Queen’s Park  west London  who studied computer programming at the University of Westminster  is said to have travelled to the Middle East in 2012 and later joined ISIS Jihadi John has featured in the horrifying execution videos of U S  journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff  aid worker David Haines  22 Syrian soldiers and Japanese reporter Kenji Goto Scroll down for video

Unmasked  The ISIS executioner  Jihadi John  has been identified as Mohammed Emwazi from west London

Arabic speaker Mr Emwazi  who first moved to Britain aged six  was reported to have been raised in a middle class family and occasionally prayed at a mosque in Greenwich  south east London But after graduating from university in 2009  he claimed to have been harassed and intimidated by the security services   and even complained to the Independent Police Complaints Commission Mr Emwazi alleged an agent from MI5 knew ‘everything about me  where I lived  what I did  and the people I hanged around with’ and claimed the organisation attempted to ‘turn’ him to work for them One of Kuwait born Mr Emwazi’s close friends identified him  telling a newspaper  ‘I have no doubt that Mohammed is Jihadi John He was like a brother to me… I am sure it is him ’

And Asim Qureshi  research director a British human rights group Cage   who had been in contact with Mr Emwazi before he left for Syria   said he also believed the man was Jihadi John Mr Qureshi told the Washington Post  ‘There was an extremely strong resemblance This is making me feel fairly certain that this is the same person Home  Mr Emwazi’s most recent address was a flat in Leeve House  above  which is part of the Mozart Estate in Queen s Park   an area that has seen shootings and gang related troubles in the past four years

According to the newspaper  in May 2009 Mr Emwazi flew to Tanzania with friends apparently on a safari   but was arrested by police upon landing in Dar es Salaam and sent back to Britain En route he stopped in Amsterdam  where he claimed to have been accused by an MI5 officer of trying to reach Somalia  home of the militant group Al Shabaab The Washington Post reported Mr Emwazi   who has also been known as Muhammad ibn Muazzam   then moved to his native Kuwait and worked in IT  but he was detained by counter terrorism police in June 2010 upon a return trip to London They allegedly fingerprinted him and searched his belongings  and he was not allowed to fly back to Kuwait Mr Emwazi was put on a terror watch list and banned from leaving the UK The FBI said last September that authorities had been trying to identify Jihadi John using various investigative techniques including voice analysis and interviews with former hostages Scotland Yard would not confirm the name  and Downing Street declined to comment on the report Mr Emazi’s most recent address was a flat in Leeve House  part of the Mozart Estate in Queen s Park   an area that has seen shootings and gang related troubles in the past four years A spokesman for the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation at King s College London said  ‘We believe that the identity and name published by the Washington Post and now in the public realm to be accurate and correct ‘“Jihadi John” is not special  in the sense that all the foreign fighters have tried to hide their identity by using pseudonyms or literally by masking themselves ‘The fact that “Jihadi John” has been unveiled in this manner demonstrates that whatever efforts are made  the ability to mask one s identity is limited or in fact impossible  and their true identities will eventually be revealed ’

In September  it was revealed Jihadi John was known to MI5 before he travelled to Syria to join ISIS It was revealed security officials had identified him but his name and background were being kept secret to avoid jeopardising any hostage rescue missions Horrifying  Jihadi John has featured in the execution videos of American journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff  aid worker David Haines  22 Syrian soldiers and Japanese journalist Kenji Goto  pictured 

Police and security agents said they also wanted to gather more information before raiding the homes of the fanatic’s family and friends Not him  Abdel Majed Abdel Bary   a London rapper initially identified as a suspect   was ruled out

Abdel Majed Abdel Bary – a London rapper initially identified as a suspect – was ruled out after analysis of his voice as well as his height and mannerisms The 23 year old came to prominence last year after he posted a photograph of himself on Twitter holding up a severed head Other Britons from Portsmouth  Birmingham and Cardiff have been linked to John  who is said to have overseen the torture of hostages and to have led negotiations for French and Italian captives freed in return for ransoms It is claimed he was making street collections for genuine Arab charities based in London at the time he came to MI5’s attention There is no suggestion that MI5 or the police had any basis to stop him from travelling abroad David Cameron has repeatedly called for the infamous terrorist to be punished for his crimes In an interview with MailOnline last month  the Prime Minister revealed how he personally watched videos of the brutal beheadings of British hostages carried out by Jihadi John  These videos are absolutely horrific and depraved  the Prime Minister said  And obviously I take the time to see what they are doing so I understand what families have been going through Speaking in November  Mr Cameron said  ‘You should be in no doubt that I want Jihadi John to face justice for the appalling acts that have been carried out in Syria ’

Briton named as Jihadi John claimed he was repeatedly approached by MI5 to become an informant and believed he was being harassed by agents

MI5 repeatedly tried to recruit Mohammed Emwazi as an informant and put him on a terror watchlist to stop him leaving Britain but he still managed to flee the country for Syria  it was claimed today Mr Emwazi is believed to have become known to the security services in 2009 when he was accused of trying to fight with Somali terror group Al Shabaab in east Africa The British citizen  who was born in Kuwait and moved to the UK aged six  flew to Tanzania with two friends after he graduated from the University of Westminster claiming he was going on safari But he was arrested as soon as he touched down in capital Dar es Salaam and deported by Tanzanian s officials He flew back to Britain via Amsterdam and told a friend MI5 were waiting for him at Schiphol Airport and tried to recruit him to share information on extremists  Mr Emwazi told a confidant Asim Qureshi  research director at the rights group Cage told the Washington Post   Mohammed was quite incensed by his treatment  that he had been very unfairly treated Mr Emwazi claimed in emails that he was repeatedly approached by the security services over the course of the following year but he said he refused to co operate and denied he had any links to terrorism Hostages who have survived being held by ISIS in Syria and Iraq have said that Jihadi John is a man  obsessed  with Somalia and would make them watch Al Shabaab videos while in captivity In June 2010 counter terrorism officers  linked to the security services and Scotland Yard  allegedly arrested him as he tried to fly to Kuwait He was fingerprinted and searched  it was said  and put on a terror watchlist preventing him from leaving Britain In an email to Mr Qureshi he said   I feel like a prisoner  only not in a cage  in London A person imprisoned   controlled by security service men  stopping me from living my new life in my birthplace   country  Kuwait Another friend said  ‘He was upset and wanted to start a life elsewhere He at some stage reached the point where he was really just trying to find another way to get out ’

Another friend said that Emwazi later tried to travel to Saudi Arabia to teach English in 2012 but again stopped from leaving He was  desperate  to leave Britain and  was ready to exhaust every single kind of avenue within the machinery of the state to bring a change for his personal situation  Mr Qureshi said Mr Qureshi said he last heard from him that year and said the Jihadi John supect believed  actions were taken to criminalize him and he had no way to do something against these actions Soon afterwards he vanished and is believed to have travelled to Syria  where he may now be ISIS  figurehead The University of Westminster was one of the 21 university institutions which have been found to promote gender segregation Research by Student Rights  a group which aims to prevent extremism at universities  said that from September to March 2013  46 events at 21 separate institutions were found to have been segregated At the University of Westminster  at least two events were found to have been advertised as ‘women only’ The research found that on March 21  2013 a debate entitled ‘Secularism vs  Islam’ was held by the Women’s Take on Current Affairs Society  WTCA  a Hizb ut Tahrir front group  and featured Shohana Khan as a speaker When challenged by students as to why the WTCA was able to hold events segregated by gender  the Student Union Interfaith Officer allegedly claimed that the society’s events were ‘faith based’  which exempted it from equal opportunities policy In addition to this  an event the following day was held by the Islamic Society called ‘The Concept of Love in Islam’ which was also advertised as ‘Sisters only’ It was logged by Student Rights for this reason Student Rights said that when a male student from the society complained about not being able to attend  the Islamic Society highlighted that segregated events were common on campus stating ‘we’ve had many brothers only events too the information discussed in the only women talks or notes can be put to the public after the talk the topics at hand do not only concern women ’

I am probably going to lose him because he is a brand that his team wants to protect and things since he went to rehab came to my attention that didn’t put him or our relationship in the best light He is the first man I ever had intimacy with and felt comfortable and all woman When he went to rehab I had to go through all this scrutiny and tabloid mess by myself His team at Octagon abandoned me  whether he knows that or not I do not know Chandler wrote her Facebook post on November 13th  but it has only now been widely picked up by media outlets such as the Daily Mail and Daily Mirror On Wednesday  she wrote   Heard from Michael he is out of rehab and back home  while also expressing frustration about how her story is being reported Two steps forward and 100 steps backwards That is what life feels like to me right now In a world of educated people that had all the facts of intersex and what it means and then to sell a magazine say Michael Phelps is dating a MAN I have cried now for an hour  thrown up anything in my system till I dry heaved I just can t believe this is happening in 2014 ",0,384
"ISIL Beheads American Photojournalist in Iraq American photojournalist James Wright Foley has been beheaded by ISIS forces

Foley has been missing since Thanksgiving 2012 while working in Syria

ISIS posted the extremely graphic video  A Message to America  to social media

Foley speaks to camera before his death and labels the US his killers

Apparently coerced by his captors into speaking against his country

A masked and robed member of ISIS speaking English in what is thought to be a British accent addresses the camera too

After the execution of Foley  the ISIS member says that missing American journalist Steven Joel Sotloff will be killed next

A man identified as Sotloff in a caption on the video is then paraded in front of the camera

Beheading comes one day after ISIS threat to America that  we will drown all you in blood  following the US aided Kurdish recapture of the Mosul Dam

Horrific video of American freelance photo journalist James Wright Foley  40  being beheaded by ISIS in revenge for US airstrikes in Iraq was posted to the internet Tuesday afternoon Foley  has been missing since November  2012  after being taken hostage at gunpoint while reporting from Taftanaz  in northern Syria  for the agency  GlobalPost ISIS posted the extremely graphic video shot at an unknown location  titled  A Message to America  to social media as proof of their barbaric actions In a chilling warning at the end of grisly film  the executioner  who has what sounds like a British accent  paraded another American journalist  Steven Joel Sotloff  who went missing in August 2013  saying   The life of this American citizen  Obama  depends on your next decision The video emerged as President Barack Obama was returning from the White House to his Martha s Vineyard vacation White House National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden says the administration has seen the video She says that if it’s deemed genuine by the intelligence community  the US would be ‘appalled by the brutal murder of an innocent American journalist ’
His family issued a statement through their Free James Foley organization  which has been working to free the journalist  We know that many of you are looking for confirmation or answers Please be patient until we all have more information  and keep the Foleys in your thoughts and prayers As the disturbing video infolds  Foley  dressed in orange and on his knees  is unflinching to the end as he addresses the camera before his death It appears the journalist has been coerced into blaming the United States by his brutal captors His voice strong  but struggling at times to swallow as he battles against fear  he brands the US government his real killers as a man in black robes armed with a gun stands over him Foley who has been missing for almost two years also leaves a haunting message for his brother  John  who is thought to be in the US Air Force Referring to US airstrikes launched nearly two weeks ago in Iraq  Foley says  ‘I died that day  John  when your colleagues dropped that bomb on these people They signed my death certificate’ 
As the appalling video unfolds  Foley blames the  complacency and criminality  of the United States for his impending death In his final  awful message to the world  Foley pleads for more time  to have seen his family who fought for his freedom for two years again In a final insult from his vengeful executioners  Foley is made to deny his birthright as a citizen of the United States  I wish I had more time  I wish I could have the hope of freedom and see my family once again  but that ship has sailed I guess all in all  I wish I wasn’t American  says Foley before his tragic death The reporter then stops speaking and his executioner steps forward The masked  armed and black robe clad man speaks in English in what is thought to be a British accent Members of the UK s Associated Press pegged the accent to the South East of England and London  while others have claimed the accent resembles one from North Africa ‘This is James Wright Foley  an American citizen of your country As a government you have been at the forefront of the aggression towards the Islamic State  begins the executioner  You have plotted against us and gone far out of your way to find reasons to interfere in our affairs Today  your military airforce is attacking us daily in Iraq  Your strikes have caused casualties amongst Muslims You are no longer fighting an insurgency  We are an Islamic Army and a state that has been accepted by a large number of Muslims worldwide  So effectively  any aggression toward the Islamic State is aggression towards Muslims from all walks of life who have accepted the Islamic Caliphate as their leadership  So any attempt by you  Obama  to deny the Muslims their rights of living in safety under the Islamic Caliphate will result in the bloodshed of your people ’

At this point the executioner beheads Foley  who is kneeling bravely with hands tied behind his back His body is displayed with the head atop the body Then in another chilling warning  the executioner holds another man  on his kness with his hands tied behind his back  by the scruff of the neck A caption claims it is Steven Joel Soltoff The executioner says  ‘The life of this American citizen  Obama  depends on your next decision ’
GlobalPost s co founder  Charles Sennott told ABC News that there is  no reliable proof that this execution is authentic  If the video is verified  it is just unfathomable darkness to think that a life as bright as Jim Foley s ended that way  Sennott said  He was an experienced and fearless journalist who believed deeply in reporting from the frontlines The gruesome video clip opens with President Obama announcing the commencement of American air strikes on Iraq against ISIS  Today I authorized two operations in Iraq  targeted airstrikes to protect our American personnel  and a humanitarian effort to help save thousands of Iraqi civilians who are trapped on a mountain without food and water  and facing almost certain death  says Obama in a statement dated  August 7 ISIS  which has claimed control of most of northern Iraq and parts of Syria is threatening to kill Time journalist Joel Sotloff next unless President Obama ceases attacks on the terror group Sotloff has been missing since the middle of 2013 and last tweeted on August 3rd  2013 According to his Twitter account he was in Libya at the time of his disappearance Foley’s family including parents John and Diane  of Rochester  New Hampshire  have publicly appealed for their son’s release over the past two years Foley was previously held captive by pro Gaddafi forces in Libya The barbaric beheading comes one day after ISIS militants threatened to attack U S  targets  in any place  in a chilling video showing a blood spattered Star and Stripes next to the jihadist flag with the message in English   We will drown all of you in blood Unlike Al Qaeda  the Islamic State has so far focused on seizing land in Iraq and Syria for its self proclaimed caliphate  not spectacular attacks on Western targets It came as President Barack Obama on Monday announced that Kurdish peshmerga troops  supported by U S  jets  had recaptured the strategically important Mosul Dam  hailing the offensive as a  major step forward The dam had given the militants control over power and water supplies  and any breach of the vulnerable structure would have threatened thousands of lives As the U S  military strikes the Islamic State group in Iraq  Syrian President Bashar Assad s forces also stepped up their own campaign against militant strongholds in Syria Foley  who lived Boston  was previously held captive by pro Gaddafi forces for six weeks in Libya in 2011 He was released after 45 days following an international campaign by his friends and family The Foley family from Rochester  New Hampshire  had hoped keeping silent could aid his release from Syria  but early last year decided to appeal directly to his kidnappers  increasingly concerned as they grew increasingly concerned  We want Jim to come safely home  or at least we need to speak with him to know he s okay  his father John Foley said in a statement in January 2013 as the Foley family launched a website to publicize his disappearance   Jim is an objective journalist and we appeal for the release of Jim unharmed To the people who have Jim  please contact us so we can work together toward his release James  or Jim as he is known to his family and friends  is one of five children to parents John and Diane Foley Foley  who studied at Marquette University  Milwaukee  and later studied journalism at Northwestern University  Chicago  has also reported on the war in Iraq and Afghanistan Prior to a career in journalism  he taught reading and writing skills to convicted felons at Cook County Jail in Chicago ",0,385

"Video showing American journalist beheaded believed real  officials and family say President Obama declared that the entire world was “appalled” by the beheading of an American journalist by militants in Syria  but vowed that America would not change course in Iraq  where the United States has been conducting airstrikes against terrorists  despite threats by the group to kill another reporter in the days ahead “The United States of America will continue to do what we must do to protect our people ” Mr  Obama said in a brief statement from Martha’s Vineyard  where he was vacationing “We will be vigilant and we will be relentless ”

Before speaking to reporters  Mr  Obama said he placed a phone call to the parents of James Foley  the slain reporter  telling them that Americans were “are all heartbroken at their loss ” He described Mr  Foley as a “journalist  a son  a brother and a friend who was “taken from us in an act of violence that shocked the conscience of the entire world ”

But the president’s harshest and most emotional words were reserved for the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria  the militants who released a video of the killing of Mr  Foley on Tuesday American intelligence agencies on Wednesday verified the authenticity of the video  which shows a masked man decapitating James Foley  an American journalist who was kidnapped in Syria nearly two years ago It also shows another American captive  the journalist Steven Sotloff  and warns that he would be the next to die The president called ISIS a “cancer” in the region and accused them of having “rampaged across cities and villages  killing unarmed civilians in cowardly acts of violence ” He said it had committed torture and rape against innocent women and children and continued to enslave those they did not kill “No faith teaches people to massacre innocents ” Mr  Obama said “No just God would stand for what they did yesterday and what they do every single day People like this ultimately fail They fail because the future is won by people who build and not destroy ”

The killing of Mr  Foley triggered a fierce response The New York Daily News and The New York Post both used the same banner headline on their front pages  “Savages ” Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain released a statement saying “the brutal murder of James Foley is shocking and depraved ”

At the United Nations  Secretary General Ban Ki moon issued a statement condemning ISIS for “the horrific murder of journalist James Foley  an abominable crime ” Mr  Ban said “the perpetrators of this and other such horrific crimes must be brought to justice ”

The four minute  40 second video was posted on YouTube but the website later took it down Titled “A Message to America ” it shows Mr  Foley kneeling in a desert landscape  clad in an orange jumpsuit in an apparent reference to the uniforms worn by prisoners at the American military detention camp in Guantánamo Bay  Cuba Standing to his left is a masked ISIS fighter who begins speaking in English  with what sounds like an East London accent Pulling out a knife  he says that Mr  Foley’s execution is in retaliation for the recent American airstrikes ordered by Mr  Obama against the extremist group in Iraq ",0,387

"Tiger Woods  agent shoots down report of failed drug test Dan Olsen  a former ish PGA Golfer  went on The Game 730 AM’s Mad Dog in the Morning on Friday  and lobbed some grenades at Tiger Woods “I’ve heard that he’s suspended ” said Olsen “I’ve heard that he’s on a month suspension And it’s kind of a strong witness It’s a credible person that’s telling me this It’s not testosterone but it’s something else I think when it’s all said and done that he’s gonna surpass Lance Armstrong with infamy ”

Olsen also accused Woods of using shady golf balls  implied that there would be an institutional cover up because the PGA needs to market Tiger  and insinuated that he’s faking his back injury “His back’s not hurt ” Olsen said “He was limping  and he was faking worse than I’ve ever seen him fake ”

ESPN obtained comment from the PGA  and Tiger Woods’ agent 

Ty Votaw  the executive vice president of the PGA Tour  denied any of the claims brought forth by Olsen “There is no truth whatsoever to these claims ” Votaw said “We categorically deny these allegations ”

The Tour almost never comments on disciplinary matters Woods said on Feb  11 that he was taking a break to deal with the issues in his game after withdrawing during the first round last month of the Farmers Insurance Open “Over the past year  Woods has withdrawn with an injury three times and now fallen outside of the 70 in the world These claims are absolutely  unequivocally and completely false ” said Woods’ agent  Mark Steinberg  in a statement “They are unsourced  unverified and completely ridiculous The PGA Tour has confirmed that there is no truth to these claims ”

"Priest  claim of seeing God as a woman dismissed as hoax Boston   So lately  tongues have been wagging due to a recent story of an elderly priest who died and had a conversation with God  and a female God at that The story has been dancing around on Facebook  Twitter  and Reddit It s also sallied across the seas and made it into the African media and the Indian media The story even made it s way to that holy land of obnoxious religious redneckery known as Texas The story goes something like this 
An old fart  er  I mean Catholic priest  in Massachusetts was officially dead for over 48 minutes before medical staff  miraculously  re started his heart  World News Daily Report says All the while  Father John Micheal O Neal says he went to heaven and met God  who was all motherly and feminine and just happened to be a woman Father O Neal  71  was rushed to the hospital in late January after being hit with a major heart attack  but was declared dead shortly after his arrival He was brought back to life via some sort of newfangled mechanical gadgetry and doctors at Massachusetts General Hospital  used more newfangled mechanical gadgetry to unclog vital arteries to his brain Soon they returned his heart to a normal rhythm Father O Neal woke up less than 48 hours later and recovered perfectly  World News Daily Report says Well  of course I mean  after all  if you re going to have a story about some elderly dude talking to God  you can t really have him die  can you That wouldn t come out in the wash There was much wringing of hands  and Catholic Blogger Bridget Mary Meehan wrote 
 The declarations of the cleric caused quite a stir in the catholic clergy of the archdiocese over the last few days  causing the Archbishop to summon a press conference to try and calm the rumors Despite the disapproval of his superiors  Father O Neal says that he will continue dedicating his life to God and spread the word of the  Holy Mother Then she wonders 
 Why is Cardinal O Malley and the Boston Archdiocese so upset You would think he d be inspired Perhaps  he is afraid that if God is a woman  then  that could put a big crack in the church s stained glass ceiling and open the door to women priests Sure  why not employ more delusional people They re certainly entertaining But why is the good Archbishop bothered Perhaps because Father John Micheal O Neal doesn t exist You see  he s really a nice old man on Shutterstock  who probably wishes he were somewhere else other than the hospital Terrence Donilon  a spokesman for Archbishop Sean P  O Malley says the story is a hoax  We do not have a priest of this name  he told Metro co uk  I believe this could be a hoax story And despite whatever Meehan thinks  it s never been verified that O Malley ever issued a public disavowal of the priest s alleged statements It s just not in the public records  About com reports Perhaps  as this story runs its course  the media will realize it was asleep when it should have been awake You see  World News Daily  makes no bones about the fact that it s a satire site Here s the site s disclaimer

"Saudi Arabian cleric issues fatwa against snowmen A prominent Saudi Arabian cleric has whipped up controversy by issuing a religious edict forbidding the building of snowmen  describingt them as anti Islamic Asked on a religious website if it was permissible for fathers to build snowmen for their children after a snowstorm in the country’s north  Sheikh Mohammed Saleh al Munajjid replied  “It is not permitted to make a statue out of snow  even by way of play and fun ”

Quoting from Muslim scholars  Munajjid argued that to build a snowman was to create an image of a human being  an action considered sinful under the kingdom’s strict interpretation of Sunni Islam “God has given people space to make whatever they want which does not have a soul  including trees  ships  fruits  buildings and so on ” he wrote in his ruling That provoked swift responses from Twitter users writing in Arabic and identifying themselves with Arab names “They are afraid for their faith of everything   sick minds ” one Twitter user wrote Another posted a photo of a man in formal Arab garb holding the arm of a “snow bride” wearing a bra and lipstick “The reason for the ban is fear of sedition ” he wrote A third said the country was plagued by two types of people  “A people looking for a fatwa  religious ruling  for everything in their lives  and a cleric who wants to interfere in everything in the lives of others through a fatwa ”

"Terrorist Plot Targeting Black Friday Shoppers Uncovered The Department of Homeland Security has received serious and credible information indicating that an extremist splinter group of Al Qaeda  now going by the name Bhakkar Fatwa  is planning multiple attacks against American consumers as they wait in line for stores to open on November 28th  the day known as Black Friday Bhakkar Fatwa is a small  relatively unknown group of Islamic militants and fanatics that originated in Bhakkar Pakistan as the central leadership of Al Qaeda disintegrated under the pressures of U S  military operations in Afghanistan and drone strikes conducted around the world The group has since branched out and begun aggressively recruiting throughout the Middle East  Africa and Europe Within the last year the group has come under increased scrutiny by both the CIA and the Department of Homeland Security as they have begun actively recruiting on American soil Jeh Johnson  Director of the Department of Homeland Security  has referred to Bhakkar Fatwa as the number one growing problem on the domestic terrorism front in America Their presence is felt in many mosques and islamic centers across the country  always quietly and out of sight  and previously without any violent operations Officials at both the CIA and Homeland Security think that may be about to change Jack Phillips  agent in charge of monitoring Bhakkar Fatwa’s American operation detailed the agencies recent findings “Working with both the CIA and the NSA we were able to access conversations and communications between members of Bhakkar Fatwa’s domestic organization and their leadership in Pakistan which indicate that several attacks are planned against American citizens at retail operations on the 28th of November”  said Phillips “The instructions sent from Pakistan detailed a broad plan of attacks using both firearms and homemade explosives against large crowds gathered outside of stores waiting for the sales that have become the hallmark of the day The leadership of Bhakkar Fatwa views the American religion as one worshiping money and possessions They commanded these attacks as being against the ‘holiest temples’ that the Americans serve ”

“We have taken several actions based off of this information”  stated Phillips “We have detained three individuals who were in active communication with Pakistani leadership regarding these planned terror attacks All three are undergoing interrogation as we speak so that we may hopefully determine the scope and extent of attacks that have been planned The names of those detained will not be immediately released They have been deemed enemy combatants and releasing their identities could impact our operational ability at this point Everything conceivable is being done to unmask and deal with this new threat ”

“If you are going out shopping early on Friday please keep your eyes open”  Phillips advised ” At this juncture we are unsure as to how great the threat from these attacks is going to be We are working as quickly as we can to resolve this situations  but this terrorist group is savvy They utilize a small closed cell structure  and we may not be able to identify all of them in time I urge all Americans to strongly consider whether the sales are worth the risk And if you do go out take particular caution while waiting in line for the store to open Intelligence points to the time spent waiting outside of the store as the time of greatest vulnerability I am sure we will resolve this issue  but I still recommend taking adequate precautions ”",0,400

The news stories were apparently based on a misreading of remarks Pope Francis made at his weekly general audience at the Vatican on Nov  26 and on a comment that a past pope did make several decades ago Pope Paul VI  who died in 1978  once said  reportedly while comforting a child whose dog had died   one day we will see our animals in the eternity of Christ  There is a fundamental rule in journalism That is double checking  and in this case it was not done  the Vatican s deputy spokesman  Father Ciro Benedettini  said on Saturday  when asked about how the media ran with the story cComments

The spokesman said he received a number of calls on the story from outside Italy on Friday and was taken by surprise because he did not recall the pope saying anything like that Religion News Service was among the first media to set the record straight It said in an article published late on Friday that the error appeared to have stemmed from a piece in the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera on Nov  27  whose headline was misleading The article recounted the pope s words from his general audience on Nov  26  when the topic was the transformation of all creation into a new heaven and a new earth It cited the remark about animals and attributed it to Paul VI  but its headline said  The pope and animals  paradise is open to all creatures The New York Times  which ran a story on Thursday about the purported comment by Francis  acknowledged its mistake  saying in a correction on Friday that it had misattributed the remark by Paul VI to the current pope Asked about the mistake  a spokeswoman for the Times quoted Michael Slackman  managing editor of international news  as saying   The correction in The Times notes that the specific content and wording were wrong in the article However  the pope did in fact make comments suggesting heaven is open to animals In his Nov  26 remarks  the pope referred to heaven saying  the Sacred Scripture teaches us that the fulfillment of this marvelous plan cannot but affect all that which surrounds us and which emerged from the thought and the heart of God He did not refer specifically to animals in his remarks On its website  CNN also corrected its story  noting the misattribution and saying it was unclear what Francis believes about pets going to heaven A spokeswoman for CNN had no immediate comment Reuters did not publish a story on the remarks erroneously attributed to Francis WHAT DOES THE POPE THINK ABOUT PETS As for what Francis does think about animals  he has not spoken much about them in public  but Benedettini said that from the general tone of his speeches and gestures  it is clear that he is in spiritual harmony with all of creation The spokesman said the pope was preparing an encyclical that will deal in part with the environment and recalled that a group that looks after stray dogs once brought the animals to his general audience and the pope was pleased When he made a Christmas season visit to a Rome parish last year  Francis willingly let a young girl place a lamb on his shoulders as a shepherd would carry it The pope once told priests that a good pastor should know not only the names of his parishioners but also the names of their dogs  Benedettini said Recent popes have said different things about the possible spiritual side of animals In 1990  Pope John Paul implied that animals had souls because they too were created from the breath of God In 2008  former Pope Benedict upset some animal lovers when he said only humans were  called to eternity Reuters",0,409

"Islamic State  in video titled  A Message to America  beheads American journalist James Wright Foley who was kidnapped in 2012 In a horrifying act of revenge for U S  airstrikes in northern Iraq  militants with the Islamic State extremist group have beheaded American journalist James Foley — and are threatening to kill another hostage  U S  officials say The White House must now weigh the risks of adopting an aggressive policy to destroy the Islamic State against resisting any action that could result in the death of another American It will also confront the potentially necessary step of pursuing the Islamic State in Syria  where President Barack Obama has resisted launching airstrikes or deploying significant American firepower Obama was expected to make a statement Wednesday about Foley s killing U S  officials confirmed a grisly video released Tuesday showing Islamic State militants beheading Foley Separately  Foley s family confirmed his death in a statement posted on a Facebook page that was created to rally support for his release  saying they  have never been prouder of him  He gave his life trying to expose the world to the suffering of the Syrian people  said the statement  which was attributed to Foley s mother  Diane Foley She implored the militants to spare the lives of other hostages  Like Jim  they are innocents They have no control over American government policy in Iraq  Syria or anywhere in the world Foley  40  from Rochester  New Hampshire  went missing in northern Syria in November 2012 while freelancing for Agence France Presse and the Boston based media company GlobalPost The car he was riding in was stopped by four militants in a contested battle zone that both Sunni rebel fighters and government forces were trying to control He had not been heard from since The beheading marks the first time the Islamic State has killed an American citizen since the Syrian conflict broke out in March 2011  upping the stakes in an increasingly chaotic and multilayered war The killing is likely to complicate U S  involvement in Iraq and the Obama administration s efforts to contain the group as it expands in both Iraq and Syria The group is the heir apparent of the militancy known as al Qaida in Iraq  which beheaded many of its victims  including American businessman Nicholas Berg in 2004 The video released on websites Tuesday appears to show the increasing sophistication of the Islamic State group s media unit and begins with scenes of Obama explaining his decision to order airstrikes It then cuts to a balding man in an orange jumpsuit kneeling in the desert  next to a black clad militant with a knife to his throat Foley s name appears in both English and Arabic graphics on screen After the captive speaks  the masked man is shown apparently beginning to cut at his neck  the video fades to black before the beheading is completed The next shot appears to show the captive lying dead on the ground  his head on his body The video appears to have been shot in an arid area  there is no vegetation to be seen and the horizon is in the distance where the sand meets the gray blue sky At the end of the video  a militant shows a second man  who was identified as another American journalist  Steven Sotloff  and warns that he could be the next captive killed Sotloff was kidnapped near the Syrian Turkish border in August 2013  he had freelanced for Time  the National Interest and MediaLine One U S  official said the video appeared to be authentic  and two other U S  officials said the victim was Foley All three officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the killing by name Several senior U S  officials with direct knowledge of the situation said the Islamic State very recently threatened to kill Foley to avenge the crushing airstrikes over the past two weeks against militants advancing on Mount Sinjar  the Mosul dam and the Kurdish capital of Irbil Both areas are in northern Iraq  which has become a key front for the Islamic State as its fighters travel to and from Syria Since Aug  8  the U S  military has struck at least 70 Islamic State targets — including security checkpoints  vehicles and weapons caches It s not clear how many militants have been killed in the strikes  although it s likely that some were The Islamic State militant group is so ruthless in its attacks against all people they consider heretics or infidels that it has been disowned by al Qaida s leaders In seeking to impose its harsh interpretation of Islamic law in the lands it is trying to control  the extremists have slain soldiers and civilians alike in horrifying ways — including mounting the decapitated heads of some of its victims on spikes The New York based Committee to Protect Journalists estimated Tuesday that about 20 journalists are missing in Syria  and has not released their nationalities In its annual report in November  the committee concluded that the missing journalists were either being held and threatened with death by extremists  or taken captive by gangs seeking ransom The group s report described the widespread seizure of journalists as unprecedented and largely unreported by news organizations in the hope that keeping the kidnappings out of public view may help in the captives  release

Kevin Vickers  Sergeant At Arms  Shoots a Shooting Suspect in Ottawa  Called a ‘Hero’  Pictures 

See an Associated Press update below 2 dead in shooting attack at Canada’s Parliament

OTTAWA  Ontario—A Canadian soldier standing guard at a war memorial in the country’s capital was shot to death Wednesday  and heavy gunfire then erupted inside Parliament One gunman was killed  and police said they were hunting for as many as two others The bloodshed immediately raised the specter of a coordinated terrorist attack  with Canada already on alert because of a deadly hit and run earlier in the week against two Canadian soldiers by a man who police say was fired up with radical Muslim fervor Witnesses said the soldier was gunned down at point blank range by a man carrying a rifle and dressed all in black  with a scarf over his face They said the gunman then ran off and entered Parliament  a few hundred yards away  where dozens of shots soon rang out People fled the complex by scrambling down scaffolding erected for renovations  while others took cover inside as police with rifles and body armor took up positions outside and cordoned off the normally bustling streets around Parliament Police gave no details on how the gunman died But on Twitter  Member of Parliament Craig Scott credited Parliament sergeant at arms Kevin Vickers with shooting the attacker just outside the MPs’ caucus rooms Ottawa police spokesman Chuck Benoit said two or three gunmen were believed to be involved in the attacks Gilles Michaud  assistant commissioner of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police  called it a “dynamic  unfolding situation ”

Ottawa Hospital said it received two patients  both listed in stable condition  in addition to the soldier “Today is a sad and tragic day for our city and our country ” Ottawa Mayor Jim Watson said He said it was a tragedy with “origins as yet not fully known  causes not yet fully understood ”

In Washington  President Barack Obama condemned the shootings as “outrageous ” and in a telephone call with the prime minister  offered U S  help and reassurance of the American people’s solidarity with Canada The U S  Embassy in Ottawa was locked down as a precaution  and security was tightened at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at Arlington National Cemetery just outside Washington Tony Zobl said he witnessed the soldier being gunned down from his fourth floor window directly above the National War Memorial  a 70 foot  arched granite cenotaph  or tomb  with bronze sculptures commemorating World War I “I looked out the window and saw a shooter  a man dressed all in black with a kerchief over his nose and mouth and something over his head as well  holding a rifle and shooting an honor guard in front of the cenotaph point blank  twice ” Zobl told the Canadian Press news agency “The honor guard dropped to the ground  and the shooter kind of raised his arms in triumph holding the rifle ”

Zobl said the gunman then ran up the street toward Parliament Hill Cabinet minister Tony Clement tweeted that at least 30 shots were heard inside Parliament  where Conservative and Liberal MPs were holding their weekly caucus meetings “I’m safe locked in a office awaiting security ” Kyle Seeback  another member of Parliament  tweeted The top spokesman for Prime Minister Stephen Harper said Harper was safe and had left Parliament Hill ",0,441

"ISIL Beheads American Photojournalist in Iraq President Barack Obama denounced Islamic State  Isis  militants for murdering an American journalist in retaliation for US air strikes in Iraq  showing an anger he has rarely displayed in remarks about the Iraq conflict “No just god would stand for what they did yesterday and every single day ” Obama said Wednesday in brief remarks from Edgerton  Massachusetts  where he is vacationing Hours after US intelligence authenticated a gruesome Isis videotape showing the execution of captive journalist James Foley  an act committed with the goal of deterring future US strikes on Isis  Obama said that Isis “has no place in the 21st century ” and called on allies to help defeat a “cancer so it does not spread ”

Obama did not announce any intensification of his bombing campaign  now in its thirteenth day US Central Command has yet to announce any new strikes since the Tuesday appearance of the social media borne Foley video  although sporadic reports from Iraq have indicated some may have taken place Wednesday An emotional Obama ran through a litany of Isis human rights abuses  from rape to enslavement  calling them “cowardly acts of violence ” In a vague reference to Americans held captive by Isis or near its path in Iraq  Obama said the US would “do everything we can to protect our people ” a formulation that has preceded US military action in the past With the death of the first American in Iraq since the US military withdrew in 2011  pressure is mounting on Obama to expand his already growing and amorphous air war against Isis The stated purpose of nearly two weeks of bombing has moved from the rescue of mostly Yazidi Iraqi civilians at risk of genocide to providing air cover for Kurdish and Iraqi forces wresting the strategically vital Mosul Dam away from Isis Aides to Obama pointed out from the start that threats to critical infrastructure would likely prompt a US reprisal Buffeted between calls to destroy Isis and criticism of their shifting rationale  Obama and the Pentagon have strenuously objected to a charge of mission creep They point out the consistency of the goals Obama has articulated since 8 August  preventing humanitarian catastrophe and protecting US personnel in Iraq Yet both are broad enough to encompass aerial protection of Iraqi Kurdistan and the destruction of Isis vehicles  artillery and fixed positions from Mount Sinjar to the Mosul Dam The murder of Foley – delivered after he gave a statement at knifepoint blaming the US for his death – and Isis’s threat to kill another American journalist  Steven Sotloff  is also testing Obama’s goal of safeguarding US nationals in a country overrun by Isis National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said Wednesday that the video showed both Foley and Sotloff Leaders from the UK  France and other countries lined up to excoriate Isis for the slaying British prime minister David Cameron called it “shocking” and cut short his summer holiday to chair meetings on a response A particularly acute concern for the UK government is the British accent heard from Foley’s masked killer US intelligence believes hundreds of westerners  including Americans  have joined Isis In the UK  Scotland Yard’s counter terrorism command  SO15  launched an investigation into the video as leading linguistics experts said the man sounded like he was from London or the south east of England The British foreign secretary  Philip Hammond  said of the video  “All the hallmarks point to it being genuine We’re very concerned by the apparent fact that the murderer in question is British and we are urgently investigating – agencies on both sides of the Atlantic – are first of all looking to authenticate the video  to make sure that it is genuine  and sadly it appears to be  and then to see if we can identify the individual in question ”

A spokesman for German chancellor Angela Merkel called Foley’s murder barbaric Laurent Fabius  the French foreign minister  said it exposed Isis as the “caliphate of barbarism” French president Francois Hollande told Le Monde that a global effort “beyond the traditional debate of intervention or non intervention” was necessary to confront Isis  and proposed an international meeting next month With a brutality so severe it prompted al Qaida to divorce it from the terrorist franchise  Isis has fulfilled a jihadist aspiration to carve out a state It flies a flag  sets up internal police to govern its subjects’ adherence to its interpretation of Islamic laws and customs  and maintains financial viability through the control of seized oil assets While other jihadist entities employ terrorist and insurgent tactics  for which infiltration of another’s populace is central  Isis has mustered a highly mobile army that seizes and holds territory Foley’s killer emphasized in a propaganda video that Isis is a state  not a terrorist group  a distinction that is fundamental to the group’s prestige On Wednesday  Obama repeatedly called Isis “terrorists ”

The Committee to Protect Journalists said the murder of Foley  40  who went missing during a reporting trip to Syria in 2012  “sickens all decent people” “Foley went to Syria to show the plight of the Syrian people  to bear witness to their fight  and in so doing to fight for press freedom ” Sandra Mims Rowe  the group’s chair  said in a statement In a Facebook message attributed to her  Foley’s mother Diane said  “We have never been prouder of our son Jim He gave his life trying to expose the world to the suffering of the Syrian people ” She also asked the media and the public to respect her family’s privacy Obama hailed Foley  who he called Jim  and said he had called Foley’s parents Foley’s murder  Obama said  was “an act of violence that shocks the conscience of the entire world ”",0,444

"No  Vladimir Putin did not get pooped on by a bird during a First World War speech A video that appears to a show a bird pooping on Russian President Vladimir Putin’s suit during a speech last week is fake The video–uploaded to YouTube–is going viral A few media outlets appear to have been tricked by it The video is titled  “Bird pooped on Putin at opening of WWI monument ”

The Washington Post and TIME magazine both posted the video  apparently believing it The Post issued a correction  saying that “a bird did not defecate on Russian President Vladimir Putin during a speech on Friday The video appears to have been a hoax ”

TIME wrote  “A video shared online made it seem as if Vladimir Putin got some unwelcome love from a feathered friend Sunday during a speech unveiling a monument to Russians who served in World War I ”

Obama  Putin discuss Ukraine  missile treaty

WASHINGTON  AP  — Capping a week of aggressive action against Russia  President Barack Obama pressed Russian President Vladimir Putin Friday for a diplomatic path out of Ukraine’s struggle with Moscow backed pro Russian separatists Putin countered by calling U S  and European economic sanctions against Russia counterproductive Obama later conceded that pressure from recently imposed U S  and European measures to squeeze the Russian economy “hasn’t resolved the problem yet ”

In an Obama initiated phone call Friday  the U S  president also raised concerns that Russia violated a key Cold War era nuclear weapons treaty  the White House said In a letter this week from Obama to Putin and in an administration report released this week  the United States said Russia violated a 1987 treaty that bans all U S  and Russian missiles of intermediate range  meaning those that can travel between about 300 miles and about 3 400 miles Putin in the call said the sanctions seriously damage bilateral cooperation and general global stability  according to a Kremlin report on the call It was the first conversation between the leaders since the U S  and Europe slapped the new round of economic sanctions on Russia and since Obama’s letter claiming a breach in the missile treaty “I indicated to him  just as we will do what we say we do in terms of sanctions  we’ll also do what we say in terms of wanting to resolve this issue diplomatically if he takes a different position ” Obama told reporters later The Kremlin said both Obama and Putin underscored the urgency for bringing an end to fighting in eastern Ukraine and spoke positively about a meeting that took place the day before in Minsk  Belarus  among members of a diplomatic “contact group” pursuing an end to hostilities That group includes representatives from Russia  Ukraine and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe ",0,449

The declarations of the cleric caused quite a stir in the catholic clergy of the archdiocese over the last few days  causing the Archbishop to summon a press conference to try and calm the rumors Despite the disapproval of his superiors  Father O’neal says that he will continue dedicating his life to God and spread the word of the “Holy Mother” “I wish to continue preaching” says the elderly cleric “I would like to share my new knowledge of the Mother  the Son and the Holy Ghost with all catholics and even all Christians God is great and almighty despite being a woman…”

"Magic mushrooms found at Buckingham Palace A hallucinogenic fungi has been found growing in the Queen’s garden at Buckingham Palace after being discovered by gardening expert Alan Titchmarsh The television presenter unearthed the fungi at Buckingham Palace for an ITV gardening show called The Queen’s Garden  and said  “I won’t be eating any of that ”

Titchmarsh came across the red and white spotted toadstool — called Amanita muscaria  or fly agaric — on a tour of the private 40 acre plot with ecology expert Professor Mick Crawley Titchmarsh  65  asks in an ITV show to be screened on Christmas Day  “Is it edible ”

Professor Crawley replies  “That depends what you mean It’s eaten in some cultures for its hallucinogenic affects But it also makes people who eat it very sick “The old fashioned thing to do was to feed it to the village idiot  then drink his urine because you get all of the high without any of the sickness ”

Titchmarsh jokingly replies  “I think I’ll forgo that and stick to normal mushrooms ”

Then he adds  “Not something to try at home ”

Later he told The Sun newspaper  “That was a surprise but it shows just how varied the species are I won’t be eating any of that  though  no My idea of hard drugs is Nurofen ”

On the new TV show  Titchmarsh explains that gardeners actively encourage mushrooms and toadstools He says  “Every time they chop something down  they leave out the wood to rot ”

Magic mushroom is a slang term for any hallucinogenic fungus The most common  illegal form contains drug psilocybin  but there is no suggestion this grows in the Palace garden Last night a Palace spokesman told the Sun  “For the avoidance of doubt  fungi from the garden are not used in the Palace kitchens ”

The new programme will show viewers an entire year in the life of the Buckingham Palace garden  from the summer garden parties to the nocturnal wanderings of wildlife in the heart of London It will demonstrate how gardeners work tirelessly to maintain the Queen’s flowers  while bearing in mind her wish to see animals and insects made welcome in the gardens  swapping pesticides for homemade garlic treatments Titchmarsh will explore how bee hives  homes for insects and deposits from the Royal mews each help cultivate the gardens of Buckingham Palace  with top tips from gardeners giving insight into the Queen’s own tastes The programme  to be broadcast by ITV on Christmas Day  will also show how the garden has been used by the royal family for generations  from the king who planted mulberry trees to rival the French to the young Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret climbing to peer over the high garden walls A sandpit used by the royal children will be filmed  along with oak trees planted decades ago by the young Prince of Wales and Princess Royal  grown from acorns sown on the event of their birth Titchmarsh  who spent 12 months exploring how the Palace garden changed with the seasons  will be seen finishing the calendar year with a Christmas tree mounted in the Marble Hall  decorated with holly and mistletoe from the royal garden and festooned with festive golden crowns ",0,472

"James Foley remembered as  brave and tireless  journalist President Obama declared that the entire world was “appalled” by the beheading of an American journalist by militants in Syria  but vowed that America would not change course in Iraq  where the United States has been conducting airstrikes against terrorists  despite threats by the group to kill another reporter in the days ahead “The United States of America will continue to do what we must do to protect our people ” Mr  Obama said in a brief statement from Martha’s Vineyard  where he was vacationing “We will be vigilant and we will be relentless ”

Before speaking to reporters  Mr  Obama said he placed a phone call to the parents of James Foley  the slain reporter  telling them that Americans were “are all heartbroken at their loss ” He described Mr  Foley as a “journalist  a son  a brother and a friend who was “taken from us in an act of violence that shocked the conscience of the entire world ”

But the president’s harshest and most emotional words were reserved for the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria  the militants who released a video of the killing of Mr  Foley on Tuesday American intelligence agencies on Wednesday verified the authenticity of the video  which shows a masked man decapitating James Foley  an American journalist who was kidnapped in Syria nearly two years ago It also shows another American captive  the journalist Steven Sotloff  and warns that he would be the next to die The president called ISIS a “cancer” in the region and accused them of having “rampaged across cities and villages  killing unarmed civilians in cowardly acts of violence ” He said it had committed torture and rape against innocent women and children and continued to enslave those they did not kill “No faith teaches people to massacre innocents ” Mr  Obama said “No just God would stand for what they did yesterday and what they do every single day People like this ultimately fail They fail because the future is won by people who build and not destroy ”

The killing of Mr  Foley triggered a fierce response The New York Daily News and The New York Post both used the same banner headline on their front pages  “Savages ” Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain released a statement saying “the brutal murder of James Foley is shocking and depraved ”

At the United Nations  Secretary General Ban Ki moon issued a statement condemning ISIS for “the horrific murder of journalist James Foley  an abominable crime ” Mr  Ban said “the perpetrators of this and other such horrific crimes must be brought to justice ”

“I’m here  I’m there  I’m Big Bank Hank  everywhere ” he raps Again  he had no idea how true that was  though he witnessed the music s evolution over the following decades as the hip hop style he helped popularize become a form as vital to the ever evolving story of American music as jazz and country and western Related   Big Bank Hank  of trailblazing Sugarhill Gang dies at 57

To call the Sugarhill Gang the “big bang” of hip hop diminishes the contributions of an entire community that imagined the music at its inception Big Bank Hank  after all  got his start in the business as a bouncer and managing an act that would become the Cold Crush Brothers He landed a spot in the Sugarhill Gang when the late music executive Sylvia Robinson tapped him to be part of a pop oriented rap trio she was putting together Jeff Chang’s essential history of hip hop  “Can’t Stop  Won’t Stop ” describes the song as standing out amid party oriented rap of the time due to the group’s birth as a studio creation Writes Chang  “Their raps on ‘Rapper’s Delight’ were the stuff that sounded good not in the parties  but on the live bootleg cassettes playing in the OJ cabs and on the boom boxes   the funny stories  the hookish slang  the same kind of stuff that would strike listeners around the world as both universal and new  not local and insular ”

“Rapper’s Delight” is considered the best selling 12 inch single of all time  though that’s tough to confirm in the pre Soundscan era  which began in 1991  and various litigation involving the track’s unapproved sampling of Chic’s “Good Times” further blurred the issue of numbers As happened with most first generation rap teams  and second  third  fourth  and fifth  Sugarhill Gang failed to sustain a bankable post hit career  and didn’t receive royalty checks equal to its influence In the years following the track s success  the style morphed in dozens of different directions  though  becoming politicized through Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five  electro fied through Afrika Bambaataa and popularized through Run DMC and the Beastie Boys Reverse engineer virtually any rap song since  and the circuitry leads back to  Rapper s Delight  and by extension  Big Bank Hank His phrasing  his fluid  funky tone  has endured  passed down from rapper to rapper  an invisible but essential presence Follow Randall Roberts on Twitter   liledit",0,487

 There is a fundamental rule in journalism That is double checking  and in this case it was not done  the Vatican s deputy spokesman  Father Ciro Benedettini  said on Saturday  when asked about how the media ran with the story The spokesman said he received a number of calls on the story from outside Italy on Friday and was taken by surprise because he did not recall the pope saying anything like that Religion News Service was among the first media to put the record straight It said in an article published late on Friday that the error appeared to have stemmed from a piece in the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera on Nov  27  whose headline was misleading The article recounted the pope s words from his general audience on Nov  26  when the topic was the transformation of all creation into a new heaven and a new earth It cited the remark about animals and attributed it to Paul VI  but its headline said  The pope and animals  paradise is open to all creatures The New York Times  which ran a story on Thursday about the purported comment by Francis  acknowledged its mistake  saying in a correction on Friday that it had misattributed the remark by Paul VI to the current pope A spokeswoman for the New York Times did not immediately have any comment On its website  CNN also corrected its story  noting the misattribution and saying it was unclear what Francis believes about pets going to heaven A spokeswoman for CNN had no immediate comment Reuters did not publish a story on the remarks erroneously attributed to Francis What does Pope Francis think about pets As for what Francis does think about animals  he has not spoken much about them in public  but Benedettini said that from the general tone of his speeches and gestures  it is clear that he is in spiritual harmony with all of creation The spokesman said the pope was preparing an encyclical that will deal in part with the environment and recalled that a group that looks after stray dogs once brought the animals to his general audience and the pope was pleased When he made a Christmas season visit to a Rome parish last year  Francis willingly let a young girl place a lamb on his shoulders as a shepherd would carry it The pope once told priests that a good pastor should know not only the names of his parishioners but also the names of their dogs  Benedettini said Recent popes have said different things about the possible spiritual side of animals In 1990  Pope John Paul implied that animals had souls because they too were created from the breath of God In 2008  former Pope Benedict upset some animal lovers when he said only humans were  called to eternity ",0,494
" Daysofdarkness  No  There Won t Be Six Days Of Darkness In December It may feel like winter is slowly squeezing all the sunlight out of your day  but if you see any news stories claiming Earth is headed for  Six Days of Total Darkness  then don t start stocking up on the tins of beans and torches just yet  Satirical news site  Huzlers com has been spreading this fake story far and wide on the web this week  taking in numerous Facebook and Twitter users and encouraging them to post about what they re going to be up to during the six days of darkness The story on the vaguely official looking website titled  Nasa Confirms Earth Will Experience 6 Days of Total Darkness in December 2014 claims that an incoming solar storm is to blame  causing  dust and space debris to become plentiful and thus block 90  sunlight This is false Although solar storms certainly are real phenomena  they occur due to fluctuations in Sun s magnetic field  they re not like terrestrial storms that can blow up dust and dirt A view of Pudong in Shanghai during the solar eclipse on July 22  2009  Getty Images photo 

Instead they create very minor disturbances in Earth s magnetosphere Historically there have been rare storms that could knock out electrical systems today  but they re mostly of the order of magnitude only likely to throw a homing pigeon slightly off course — not blot out Sun However  the hoax story even drafts in some credible sounding sources including Nasa chief Charles Bolden  who reportedly warned the public to stay calm Some users even linked to a  real  video of Bolden talking about  emergency preparedness  — an official sounding phrase that apparently bypasses common sense to hit the big button marked  PANIC  in the brain This photo taken near Karasjok in Norway at around 10am local time  on January 1  1996  shows a dark morning This happens because of the  polar night  effect during winters  with the center of Sun being below the horizon A polar night occurs when the night lasts for more than 24 hours This occurs only inside the polar circles The opposite phenomenon  the polar day  or midnight sun  occurs when the sun stays above the horizon for more than 24 hours  Getty Images photo 

In actuality Bolden recorded the video to encourage US families to think about what they would do in the event of an earthquake or hurricane — natural disasters that are a real enough threat in America This total darkness hoax apparently comes in a couple of flavours  some claim that a non existent  photon belt  is responsible for the blackout  and are so widespread that Nasa employees even had to debunk the rumours themselves back in 2012 Stay updated on the go with The Times of India’s mobile apps Click here to download it for your device ",0,495
"U S  airstrike kills Islamic Al Shabab terrorist leader in Somalia WASHINGTON — The Pentagon on Friday confirmed the death of the leader of the al Shabab terror group  Ahmed Abdi Godane  who was the target of a U S  airstrike Monday in Somalia The Pentagon’s press secretary  Rear Adm  John Kirby  confirmed the death in a brief written statement President Barack Obama  speaking at the conclusion of a NATO summit in Newport  Wales  said the successful U S  strike was an example of his administration’s determination to hit back at terrorists Obama said the U S  would use the same approach in degrading the Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria “We have been very systematic and methodical in going after these kind of organizations” that threaten U S  personnel and the homeland  Obama said “That deliberation allows us to do it right  but have no doubt  We will continue to do what is necessary to protect the American people ”

The White House declared a counterterrorism success “Godane’s removal is a major symbolic and operational loss to the largest al Qaida affiliate in Africa and reflects years of painstaking work by our intelligence  military and law enforcement professionals ” a White House statement said “Even as this is an important step forward in the fight against al Shabab  the United States will continue to use the tools at our disposal – financial  diplomatic  intelligence and military – to address the threat that al Shabab and other terrorist groups pose to the United States and the American people ” It added U S  officials had said after the strike on Monday that U S  special operations forces using manned and drone aircraft had destroyed an encampment and a vehicle using several Hellfire missiles and laser guided munitions But they did not confirm that Godane had been killed until Friday The State Department declared al Shabab a terrorist organization in February 2008 Kirby said on Tuesday  before the Pentagon was certain that Godane had died  that the U S  strike was conducted south of Mogadishu and that it had destroyed the vehicle that was targeted He noted that in September 2013  Godone had publicly claimed al Shabab was responsible for the deadly Westgate Mall attack in Nairobi  Kenya “Under the leadership of Godane  al Shabab has claimed responsibility for many bombings  including suicide attacks in Mogadishu and in central and northern Somalia  typically targeting officials and perceived allies of the federal government of Somalia  as well as the former transitional federal government of Somali ” Kirby said Tuesday ",0,496
"Homeland Security  No ISIL fighters on U S  border The Department of Homeland Security flatly denied on Wednesday a claim from a California Congressman that the ISIS terror army is quietly slipping into the United States through its porous southern border – and that American border patrol agents have already captured ten of its soldiers Republican Duncan Hunter told a Fox News Channel audience on Tuesday that ISIS  the self proclaimed Islamic State of Iraq and al Sham  is actively infiltrating the U S 

 I know that at least ten ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the Mexican border in Texas  he said  There s nobody talking about it But DHS fired back  saying in a statement that Hunter s claim is  categorically false SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

Rep  Duncan Hunter stunned a Fox News audience by saying that the US has apprehended about ten ISIS terrorists as they entered the country through the Mexican border

Vulnerable  Much of the Texas Mexico border is essentially undefended  with US Border Patrol agents setting up well on the American side

 The suggestion that individuals who have ties to ISIL have been apprehended at the Southwest border is categorically false  and not supported by any credible intelligence or the facts on the ground  a Homeland Security spokesman said in a statement  using the administration s preferred alternative acronym for the group  DHS continues to have no credible intelligence to suggest terrorist organizations are actively plotting to cross the southwest border CBS News reported Wednesday that one of Hunter s sources  nuanced their claims  after the Fox broadcast  saying that some of the people he referred to may have been  ISIS affiliated or possibly Americans who fought with the Syrian Free Army The FSA is an ISIS foe  not an ally Hunter s spokesman pushed back  defending his claim “The congressman was conveying what he knows – and what he was told  the spokesperson said in a statement  It makes sense that the left hand of DHS doesn’t know what the right hand is doing – it’s been that way for a long time and we don’t expect that to change Hunter  like many in the GOP  has advocated in the past for strengthening America s border security to the south  a demand that has largely fallen on deaf ears during the Obama presidency During a 2013 Senate hearing  then Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said that due to the administration s  significant progress and efforts   our borders have  in fact  never been stronger But Hunter  a member of the House Armed Services Committee  claimed Tuesday that the nation s 1 933 mile southern border represents ISIS s best hope of waging war on the U S 

 If you really want to protect Americans from ISIS  you secure the southern border  he said  It s that simple  ISIS doesn t have a navy  they don t have an air force  they don t have nuclear weapons The only way that ISIS is going to harm Americans is by coming in through the southern border – which they already have  You re talking about OUR southern border Fox host Greta can Susteren was shocked to hear Hunter s claim that ISIS is infiltrating the US

Host Greta Van Susteren was caught flat footed  Are you talking about ours she asked  You re talking about our southern border You re not talking about the southern border of Iraq  They aren t flying B 1 bombers  bombing American cities  he replied   but they are going to be bombing American cities coming across from Mexico The three term congressman cited a similar fear that Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen  Martin Dempsey expressed during an August 21 Pentagon press briefing Dempsey called ISIS  an immediate threat   because of open borders and immigration issues Hunter said his information came directly from U S  Customs and Border Protection  which has a 20 000 strong army of agents patrolling the borders in Texas  Arizona  New Mexico and California  I ve asked the border patrol  he said  adding that he was told about the ten ISIS fighters who were caught crossing the border  If they catch five or ten of them  then you know there s gonna be dozens more that did not get caught by the border patrol  he said  But that s how you know  All you have to do is ask the border patrol The government watchdog group Judicial Watch claimed in August that ISIS terrorists were  planning to attack the United States with car bombs or other vehicle born  sic  improvised explosive devices The group said a  warning bulletin for an imminent terrorist attack  had been issued to  agents across a number of Homeland Security  Justice and Defense agencies instructing them  to aggressively work all possible leads and sources  to prevent the attacks The Department of Homeland Security flatly denied that in a statement to MailOnline  We are aware of absolutely nothing credible to substantiate this claim  a bewildered DHS spokesman said

 In Mexico I haven t seen that at all Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said on the same day Judicial Watch made its claims that his agency and the FBI were  unaware of any specific  credible threat to the U S  homeland  from the terror network ",0,497

Kadalim  26  says that he was there at Euclid Liquor   Market where he had just purchased a lottery ticket before walking across the street to his girlfriend’s apartment  and that what he saw made it clear that “Thomas knew he was being followed ”

Kadalim says he is a fan of Paler Lin and recognized the YouTube celebrity immediately He then watched as Paler Lin entered the liquor store and spoke with a clerk as Thomas waited outside Only after Paler Lin returned  Kadalim told Vocativ  did Thomas enter the liquor store “He drove Thomas to the liquor store ” Kadalim told the site “While I think the guy is homeless  it is clear that from what I saw every part of that scene was staged ”

Vocativ said its reporters corroborated the story with Kadalim’s girlfriend and brother  but calls to the liquor store went unreturned Kadalim posted a comment to the video’s YouTube page the day the video went on line  saying quote clearly that Paler Lin drove Thomas to the store  but the comment went largely ignored Paler Lin  however  adamantly denied faking any part of the “homeless” viral video  telling Vocativ  “There is no way we’re making any of this up This is real ”",0,520

"Obama  murder of James Foley  shocks the conscience of the entire world  President Obama said Wednesday that the United States “will be vigilant and we will be relentless” against Islamic State militants and would “do what’s necessary to see that justice is done” following the videotaped execution of an American journalist “Today the entire world is appalled at the brutal murder of James Foley by the terrorist group ISIL ” Obama said  using one of several acronyms for the group The militants  who posted the video on YouTube Tuesday  said Foley’s killing was in retaliation for U S  airstrikes in Iraq Obama  who spoke Wednesday morning to Foley’s parents  offered no new policy measures to confront Islamic State Referring to neighboring countries and U S  allies  he said “there has to be a common effort to extract this cancer so that it does not spread ”

Asked whether the United States might consider suspending its airstrikes  one U S  official said the “only question is if we do more ” Officials said that attacks against the Islamic State would continue in Iraq under an authorization Obama signed early this month Obama could face pressure to escalate the air campaign in Iraq and increase support to U S backed rebels in Syria who are fighting against the Islamic Front  as well as Syrian President Bashar al Assad Obama has resisted pleas from the Syrian rebels for U S  heavy weapons  including portable surface to air missiles  as well as for American air support In a statement issued after the president’s remarks  Rep  Ed Royce  R Calif  chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee  said  “We must get serious about confronting this force  including by aggressively arming those battling it ”

The White House confirmed early Wednesday that U S  intelligence had deemed the video authentic Obama spoke in Martha’s Vineyard  where he is vacationing with his family Foley  a 40 year old New Hampshire native and a photojournalist working for the Boston based Web site Global­Post  was kidnapped in northern Syria nearly two years ago while covering the civil war in Syria In Britain Wednesday  Prime Minister David Cameron cut short a family vacation and returned to London to chair emergency meetings on Iraq and Syria  amid indications that a British citizen was involved in Foley’s killing In the video  his masked executioner speaks in English with what sounds like a British accent After beheading Foley  the executioner is pictured with a second captive  identified as U S  freelance journalist Steven Joel Sotloff  who disappeared last year in Syria “The life of this American citizen  Obama  depends on your next decision ” the executioner says In an interview with the BBC  British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond acknowledged that the executioner spoke with a British accent and said the video seemed to be genuine Hundreds of Britons are believed to have traveled to Syria to fight in the country’s civil war  including many who have joined the Islamic State “We’re absolutely aware that there are significant numbers of British nationals involved in terrible crimes  probably in the commission of atrocities ” Hammond said “Many of these people may seek at some point to return to the U K  and they would then pose a direct threat to our domestic security ”

A European intelligence official said the British government was examining the video  and the speech of the purported executioner  to compare it to the speech of former Guantanamo Bay prisoners and other British residents believed to have joined the Islamic State Both prisoners in the video are wearing orange shirts and pants  similar to orange jumpsuits worn by detainees at the U S  military prison at Guantanamo Bay  Cuba A similar outfit  believed to be a jihadist symbol of the prison  was worn by Nicholas Berg  an American businessman kidnapped in Iraq in 2004 whose execution by an Islamic State precursor organization was recorded on video and posted online Foley  40  was working in Syria for the Boston based news Web site Global­Post when he disappeared on Thanksgiving in 2012 In a statement Tuesday night on a Facebook page dedicated to his freedom  Foley’s mother wrote  “We have never been prouder of our son Jim ” Diane Foley wrote “He gave his life trying to expose the world to the suffering of the Syrian people “We implore the kidnappers to spare the lives of the remaining hostages Like Jim  they are innocents They have no control over American government policy in Iraq  Syria or anywhere in the world ”

Praising James Foley as “an extraordinary son  brother  journalist and person ” she asked that the family’s privacy be respected In addition to Foley and Sotloff  at least three other Americans are believed to be captives in Syria  according to a 2013 Global­Post article  including Austin Tice  a freelance journalist whose articles appeared in McClatchy publications and The Washington Post before his disappearance in August 2012 No one has claimed to be holding them According to the Committee to Protect Journalists  at least 66 journalists  all but 10 of them Syrian  have been killed covering the Syrian war If the video is authenticated  Foley would be the first American journalist known to be executed since the conflict began in early 2011 The video evoked the 2002 taped execution in Pakistan of Wall Street Journal correspondent Daniel Pearl by al Qaeda The Islamic State  an offshoot of al Qaeda  is the most powerful among a number of extremist organizations that have emerged during the Syrian civil war  which began as a popular uprising against President Bashar al Assad Fighting against both Assad and U S backed rebels  the militants now control much of eastern Syria and claim to have established an Islamic caliphate spanning Syria and neighboring Iraq As the group has grown  it has merged with the group formerly known as al Qaeda in Iraq  under the leadership of Abu Bakr al Baghdadi According to U S  intelligence  it numbers in the thousands  including foreign fighters from Europe and the United States In April  Islamic State fighters swept across the border into northern Iraq  taking over the city of Mosul before moving southward to within 60 miles of Baghdad Extensive reports of executions  including beheadings and crucifixions  have emerged from areas under the group’s control This month  amid reports of stranded and besieged Iraqi minorities threatened with execution  the militants advanced eastward toward Irbil  the capital of the semiautonomous Kurdish region of Iraq On Aug  7  Obama authorized U S  airstrikes to rescue stranded minorities and protect U S  personnel and facilities in Irbil and Baghdad On Monday  after a total of 68 strikes from jets  bombers and drones  Obama announced that Iraqi and Kurdish forces  with U S  air support  had retaken a strategic dam north of Mosul from the militants and that they had been pushed back from Irbil Within hours of that announcement  the Islamic State posted an online message warning it would attack Americans “in any place” in response to the airstrikes “We will drown all of you in blood ” it said The title of the video posted Tuesday was “A Message to America” and was produced by the Islamic State’s media arm  according to the Site Intelligence Group  which monitors extremist Web sites A masked man dressed in black is shown standing in an unidentified desert location beside a prisoner kneeling beside him with his hands behind his back “Obama authorized military operations against the Islamic State effectively placing America upon a slippery slope towards a new war against Muslims ” the masked man says The video then shows a clip of Obama’s Aug  7 announcement  followed by a statement from the prisoner “I call on my friends  family and loved ones to rise up against my real killers  the U S  government  for what will happen to me is only a result of their complacent criminality ” he says He asks his parents not to accept “any meager compensation from the same people who effectively hit the last nail in my coffin with the recent aerial campaign in Iraq ”

The prisoner also appeals to “my brother John  who is a member of the U S  Air Force ” to “think about what you are doing ”

“I wish I had more time ” he says “I wish I could have the hope for freedom to see my family once again  but that ship has sailed I guess all in all  I wish I wasn’t an American ”

The masked man then identifies the prisoner as “James Wright Foley  an American citizen of your country ” He then reaches down with a large knife and begins the apparent beheading of the prisoner  the screen fades to black and the next image is of a body with a head placed upon its back The masked man then appears with another prisoner  identified as Sotloff  in a similar kneeling position Foley reported from some of the most dangerous recent crises and was imprisoned for 44 days in Libya in 2011 by forces loyal to deposed leader Moammar Gaddafi According to Global­Post  two eyewitnesses saw his interception by a group of armed men in a silver colored van on a road near the town of Taftanaz in northern Syria on Nov  22  2012 Since then  Global­Post “has mounted an extensive international investigation    to determine who kidnapped Foley and where he was being held ” Global­Post said in an article on its Web site late Tuesday Julie Tate and Dan Lamothe in Washington  Griff Witte in London and Souad Mekhennet in Frankfurt  Germany  contributed to this report ",0,523

"Magic Mushrooms Found in Queen Elizabeth s Garden at Buckingham Palace The fungi was found by TV gardener Alan Titchmarsh

A hallucinogenic toadstool mushroom is growing in the gardens of Buckingham Palace The red and white spotted Amanita muscaria species   also known as fly agaric   has been discovered by Alan Titchmarsh while on tour of the grounds with ecology expert Professor Mick Crawley The discovery of the mushroom   which is likely to have grown on the 40 acre land without being specifically cultivated   was recorded during a 12 month study for ITV show The Queen s Garden  which is to be aired on Christmas Day Mr Titchmarsh asks Professor Crawley if the fungi is edible  to which he replies  “That depends what you mean It’s eaten in some cultures for its hallucinogenic effects But it also makes people who eat it very sick “The old fashioned thing to do was feed it to the village idiot  then drink his urine because you get all the high without any of the sickness ”

Mr Titchmarsh  known for presenting BBC gardening programme Ground Force and the annual RHS Chelsea Flower Show  then says  “I think I’ll forgo that and stick to some normal mushrooms” “Not something to try at home ” he added Chemicals muscimol and ibotenic acid found in the fungi cause psychoactive effects such as drowsiness  hallucinations  mood changes  euphoria and disassociation The plant has a long history of religious and shamanic use dating back around 10 000 years However  unlike psilocybin mushrooms   which were reclassified to Class A in 2006 and have been more popular for recreational use   the legal status of selling fly agaric in the UK remains complicated Possession is not illegal The physical effects are described as  undesirable  and the chemicals can carry risks of poisoning and death  according to drug advice charity Talk to Frank The mushrooms are culturally depicted in Lewis Carroll s Alice in Wonderland  Nintendo s Super Mario Brothers video games and in Disney s musical production Fantasia ",0,526

The problem is I have made friends that I never told and dated and married people that knew nothing of my past If you don’t understand what intersex is  Google it I was never a man  never lived as a man No one can say they knew me as a man or produce a photo of me as a man Eighteen time Olympic gold medalist Phelps spent most of October in a rehab centre after being arrested for driving under the influence in September Chandler says she met Phelps on the dating app Tinder and described their relationship as being  like a teenage love affair However  she admitted concern in her post that Phelps would end their relationship  

I am probably going to lose him because he is a brand that his team wants to protect and things since he went to rehab came to my attention that didn’t put him or our relationship in the best light He is the first man I ever had intimacy with and felt comfortable and all woman When he went to rehab I had to go through all this scrutiny and tabloid mess by myself His team at Octagon abandoned me  whether he knows that or not I do not know Chandler wrote her Facebook post on November 13th  but it has only now been widely picked up by media outlets such as the Daily Mail and Daily Mirror On Wednesday  she wrote   Heard from Michael he is out of rehab and back home  while also expressing frustration about how her story is being reported Two steps forward and 100 steps backwards That is what life feels like to me right now In a world of educated people that had all the facts of intersex and what it means and then to sell a magazine say Michael Phelps is dating a MAN I have cried now for an hour  thrown up anything in my system till I dry heaved I just can t believe this is happening in 2014 ",0,527

"Obama administration DENIES congressman s claim that  at least ten ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the Mexican border in Texas  Since the U S  began airstrikes in Iraq and Syria against the Islamic State  Republicans have frequently connected the terrorist group to border security in the U S In August  Texas Governor Rick Perry called it a “very real possibility” that fighters from the Islamic State had already crossed into the U S 

On Tuesday night  Representative Duncan Hunter  a Republican from California  took those comments even further Appearing on  On the Record with Greta Van Susteren  Hunter said  “At least ten ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the border in Texas ” When Van Susteren asked how he knew that  Hunter replied  “Because I’ve asked the border patrol  Greta ”



I asked the Department of Homeland Security if Hunter’s comments were true They weren t “The suggestion that individuals who have ties to ISIL have been apprehended at the Southwest border is categorically false  and not supported by any credible intelligence or the facts on the ground ” said DHS spokesperson Marsha Catron “DHS continues to have no credible intelligence to suggest terrorist organizations are actively plotting to cross the southwest border ”

UPDATE  Hunter isn t backing off his comments  claiming they came from a  high level source  at DHS  The Congressman was conveying what he knows—and what he was told  Hunter s spokesperson told The Huffington Post  And as for DHS’ statement  it makes sense that the left hand of DHS doesn’t know what the right hand is doing—it’s been that way for a long time and we don’t expect that to change No surprise there ",0,533
Hope Fades for Girls  Release After Boko Haram  Truce  Breached By Isaac Abrak ABUJA  Nov 1  Reuters    A man claiming to be Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau said more than 200 girls kidnapped by the group six months ago had been  married off  to its fighters  contradicting Nigerian government claims they would soon be freed Nigeria s military says it killed Shekau a year ago  and authorities said in September that they had also killed an imposter posting as him in videos In the latest recording it is hard to see the man s face as he his filmed from a distance But it is likely to raise grave doubts about whether talks between a Boko Haram faction and the government in neighboring Chad will secure the release of the girls  who were kidnapped from a secondary school in Chibok  northeast Nigeria  in April  We have have married them off and they are all in their husbands  houses  the man claiming to be Shekau says  The over 200 Chibok girls have converted to Islam  which they confess is the best religion Either their parents accept this and convert too or they can die The majority of the kidnapped girls were Christians The man in the video also denied there was a ceasefire  and denounced Ahmadu  who says he represents Boko Haram in Chad  Who says we are dialoguing or discussing with anybody Are you talking to yourselves We don t know anybody by the name of Danladi If we meet him now we will cut off his head  the man in the video says  All we are doing is slaughtering people with machetes and shooting people with guns   War is what we want He says also that they are holding a  white man The only known hostage seized in the northeast is a German teacher kidnapped from a college in the northeastern city of Gombe in July by gunmen widely assumed to be linked to Boko Haram Shekau s denial of the ceasefire appears supported by the violence since the government announced it two weeks ago It also raises doubts about the actual influence of Ahmadu The five year old campaign for an Islamic state by Boko Haram  which has killed thousands and whose name means  Western education is sinful  has become by far the biggest menace to the security of Africa s biggest economy and top oil producer Its fighters have attacked targets almost every day for weeks and last week seized control of Mubi  the home town of Nigeria s defense chief Air Chief Marshal Alex Badeh It was Badeh who announced the ceasefire They robbed banks  burned down houses and hoisted their black flag over the Emir s palace  killing dozens of people and forcing thousands to flee  witnesses in Mubi said A car bomb thought to have been planted by Boko Haram killed at least 10 people at a crowded bus stop in Gombe on Friday morning  emergency services said The government has blamed the violence on Boko Haram s allied criminal networks that it cannot control There are also thought to be several competing factions within the group  Writing by Tim Cocks  Editing by Louise Ireland ,0,534

"Canterbury Christ Church University student Jess Smith  from Chatham  starred as Teletubbies  sun As a chuckling baby  Jess Smith was one of the most familiar faces on British television in the 1990s As the BBC prepares to make 60 new episodes of the hugely popular Teletubbies  the laughing tot in the sun – who featured in all 365 programmes – is now 19 and a university student At the age of nine months  Jess Smith was selected to be the giggling Baby Sun who looks over Teletubbyland The news will come as no surprise to people who have known Jess for a long time  but she said it is not something she really talked about as she was quite a shy child and “everyone knowing would have been a bit scary” The former Chatham South and Horsted Primary School pupil made the decision to tell people during her first week at university  when they all had to say something about themselves that no one else would guess Jess Smith  from Chatham  now aged 19
She said  “I thought I may as well tell them as I’m going to be spending the next three years with them ”

Jess  a first year dance education student at Canterbury Christ Church University  then broke the news on Facebook She wrote  “So I’ve recently celebrated my 19th birthday and after a lot of thought  I’ve decided it’s time to tell everyone I used to hide it but after a lot of encouragement from my friends at university  I’ve gained the confidence to come out with it “I am the sun from Teletubbies There has been quite a few people pretending to be ‘the sun’ but only I could tell you the real story ”

In 1996  her mother  Anji Smith  took her to Edenbridge Hospital to be weighed and a health visitor  who had been asked by Ragdoll Productions to find smiley babies  put Jess’s name forward Mrs Smith said it was never intended to be a big thing  “It was just something a bit different to do and we didn’t expect it to be as big as it was “They just sat her in front of a camera and she just laughed and smiled at her dad We didn’t hear anything until we got a letter when she was 18 months old saying she’d been picked It was really weird seeing her on television ”

And as no one could predict the success of the show  Jess was paid just £250 for filming and given a box of toys to take home ",0,560

" Jihadi John  named as Mohammed Emwazi from London The masked Islamic State militant known as  Jihadi John  who has been pictured in the videos of the beheadings of Western hostages  has been named The BBC understands he is Mohammed Emwazi  a Kuwaiti born British man in his mid 20s from west London  who was known to UK security services They chose not to disclose his name earlier for operational reasons Emwazi first appeared in a video last August  when he apparently killed the American journalist James Foley He was later thought to have been pictured in the videos of the beheadings of US journalist Steven Sotloff  British aid worker David Haines  British taxi driver Alan Henning  and American aid worker Abdul Rahman Kassig  also known as Peter  The Beatles 

In each of the videos  the militant appeared dressed in a black robe with a black balaclava covering all but his eyes and top of his nose Speaking with a British accent  he taunted Western powers before holding his knife to the hostages  necks  appearing to start cutting before the film stopped The victims  decapitated bodies were then shown Earlier this month  the militant featured in a video in which the Japanese journalist Kenji Goto appeared to be beheaded Hostages released by IS said he was one of three British jihadists guarding Westerners abducted by the group in Syria They were given the nicknames  John   Paul  and  Ringo  by their captives  and were known collectively as  the Beatles Analysis  Dominic Casciani  BBC News

We don t know exactly when the British or the American security services worked out that the masked man in the killing videos was Londoner Mohammed Emwazi But we do know that he was a  person of interest  to MI5 going back to at least 2010 because he features in semi secret court cases relating to extremism overseas and back in the UK Nobody in official security circles is going to comment on what they know and why they know it Emwazi has been previously described as a member of a network involving at least 13 men from London   and at least two of them were subjected to house arrest control orders or T Pims One absconded The chances of Emwazi ever returning to the UK are vanishingly small Follow Dominic at  BBCDomC

BBC News special correspondent Lucy Manning says Emwazi is understood to be about 27 years of age Friends told the Washington Post that he was raised in a middle class area of West London and studied computer programming at the University of Westminster He would on occasion pray at a mosque in Greenwich  they said Emwazi s friends told the Washington Post that they believed he started to be radicalised after travelling to Tanzania in May 2009 following his graduation He and two friends had planned to go on a safari  but once they landed in Dar es Salaam  they were detained by police and held overnight  they said Emwazi then ended up flying to Amsterdam  in the Netherlands  where he claimed to be met by British intelligence agents from MI5 who accused him of trying to travel to Somalia  where the jihadist group al Shabab operates He denied the accusation and said the agents had tried to recruit him before allowing him to return to the UK The incident is apparently described in a report published the following year by the Independent It identified Emwazi as Muhammad ibn Muazzam  Live investigation 

Emwazi later moved to Kuwait  where he got a job at a computer company But on a visit to London in June 2010  he was detained by British counter terrorism officials and prevented from flying back to Kuwait  his friends said It is believed he was known to security services in the UK and the US before leaving for Syria and was linked to a man with connections to al Shabab  says the BBC s Dominic Casciani The Washington Post said Emwazi was believed to have travelled to Syria around 2012 and later joined Islamic State  which has declared the creation of a  caliphate  in the large swathes of Syria and neighbouring Iraq it controls British police declined to comment on the reports Commander Richard Walton  head of the Metropolitan Police s Counter Terrorism Command  said in a statement   We have previously asked media outlets not to speculate about the details of our investigation on the basis that life is at risk  We are not going to confirm the identity of anyone at this stage or give an update on the progress of this live counter terrorism investigation Jihadi John sightings",0,565
"Mexican students not among bodies found in mass graves CHILPANCINGO  Mexico  AP  — Authorities testing remains found in nine mass graves in southern Mexico have yet to find any of 43 teachers college students who disappeared after a confrontation with police  security officials said Tuesday None were among 28 bodies  some badly burned  that were unearthed a week after the Sept  26 attack  Attorney General Jesus Murillo Karam said Forensic investigators continued to test other remains and announced the discovery of 10th mass grave Tuesday Relatives of missing students march with flowers and candles to protest the disappearance of 43 students from the Isidro Burgos rural teachers college in Chilpancingo  Mexico  Tuesday  Oct  14  2014 According to Mexico s attorney general none of the missing students were among the bodies found in the first set of mass graves outside the town Authorities have said police involved in  disappearing  the students were working in conjunction with a local drug gang  AP Photo Eduardo Verdugo 

An additional 14 police officers have been arrested and confessed to participating in the disappearance  Murillo Karam said  bringing the total number of detainees to 50 The 14 are from the police force of Cocula  a town neighboring Iguala  where the confrontation took place in the southern state of Guerrero Both the mayor and police chief of Iguala are fugitives and accused of links to the local drug cartel  Guerrero Unidos  believed to have worked with police in disappearing the students The gang controls drug routes in Guerrero and Morelos states Murillo Karam said that officials had yet to identify the masterminds or a motive in the attack  but that the collusion might have gone beyond just one town  There s a connection We will determine if it was coordination or subordination  but it s clear to me that they were working together  he said of police and drug traffickers in the area Police opened fire on about 100 students who had hijacked buses to return to campus after arriving in Iguala to pass the hat for their school Teachers college students are known throughout Mexico for using radical tactics to raise money and spread their leftist philosophy Six people were killed  25 wounded and dozens of students rounded up by police There has been no sign of the missing in nearly three weeks  leading investigators to comb the clandestine burial sites outside of Iguala  where drug cartels are believed to dump their enemies On Tuesday  Guerrero Gov Angel Aguirre said many of the bodies at the first site appeared to have been buried for some time  suggesting they belonged to earlier victims of criminal gangs  Some of them are not recent  some are from months ago  Aguirre told MVS radio One forensic expert  who works with federal investigators  said identification is an arduous process that takes time Charred remains like those recovered at the first mass graves can leave very little DNA for testing  If a bone is burned at more than 300 degrees  it s almost impossible to identify because the collagen is burned Because of that  criminal organizations started to adopt that technique  said Jorge Arturo Talavera  head of the bio archaeology team at the Mexico s National Institute of Anthropology and History He said the way the remains are exhumed also can affect identification If they re pulled out in a hurried manner  other identifying articles like jewelry or teeth get discarded Hundreds of teachers  students and relatives of the missing marched to the center of the state capital  Chilpancingo  on Tuesday  taking a much more solemn tone after a night of angry protests and vandalism that badly damaged the state capital building They lined up in silence as organizers passed out white flowers Some carried candles with a sprawling billboard offering a 1 million peso  75 000  reward for information On Monday  protesters demanding to know the whereabouts of the missing smashed windows at the state capital building complex in Chilpancingo  132 miles  212 kilometers  south of Mexico City  and set fire to some of the buildings Students from the school and local teachers blockaded the capital complex  pelting it with sticks  rocks and Molotov cocktails The finance secretary of Guerrero state said six buildings were affected Also Tuesday  an alleged leader of the Guerreros Unidos killed himself during a confrontation with Mexican security forces Tuesday Federal forces were carrying out an operation to capture Benjamin Mondragon  or  Benjamon  when a gunbattle broke out  National Security Commissioner Monte Alejandro Rubido said Mondragon killed himself as he was about to be arrested  Rubido said  though he had no details on how The official said it was unclear whether Mondragon was involved in the students  disappearances President Enrique Pena Nieto said the disappearances  are without doubt a topic that will lead the Mexican government at all levels to take actions that will prevent events like those in Iguala from ever occurring again He said the government  will strengthen institutions  especially those involved in law enforcement  so that they act with greater reliability and efficiency

"Pants on Fire  Duncan Hunter makes unconfirmed claim Border Patrol caught at least 10 ISIS fighters The Department of Homeland Security definitively debunked the persistent right wing media conspiracy theory that Islamic State fighters have attempted to cross the U S Mexico border  saying the rumor is not supported by any  credible intelligence  and knocking the claim that the terrorists have been apprehended at the border as  categorically false What began early this summer as an unsubstantiated claim from Texas Gov Rick Perry  R  that  people that are coming  across the U S Mexico border  from states like Syria that have substantial connections back to terrorist regimes and terrorist operations   a claim PolitiFact Texas rated  Pants on Fire  has morphed into a full blown right wing conspiracy theory Conservative media and elected officials are hyping fears that members of the Islamic State  ISIS or ISIL  terrorist group are utilizing the U S Mexico border to enter the U S  and launch terrorist attacks  a chorus that has only grown louder in the ensuing months to attack immigration reform In September  Rep  Jason Chaffetz  R UT  claimed to have seen information detailing  four individuals trying to cross through the Texas border who were apprehended at two different stations that do have ties to known terrorists organizations in the Middle East  a story subsequently hyped by Fox News Nearly a month later  the number had jumped from four terrorists allegedly apprehended to 10 Fox News  On The Record provided a platform to Rep  Duncan Hunter  R CA  who claimed to have first hand knowledge of the terrorists crossing the border Host Greta Van Susteren replied to Hunter s allegations by asking   Do you have any information  or any evidence  that they are actually coming in the southern border now And Hunter responded   Yes  I know that at least 10 ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the Mexican border in Texas  citing information he d received from border patrol agents But the right wing talking point is  categorically false  according to the Department of Homeland Security  which oversees border security On October 8  DHS spokesperson Marsha Catron refuted the rumor that Islamic State terrorists had crossed the U S Mexico border  telling The New Republic  

 The suggestion that individuals who have ties to ISIL have been apprehended at the Southwest border is categorically false  and not supported by any credible intelligence or the facts on the ground  said DHS spokesperson Marsha Catron  DHS continues to have no credible intelligence to suggest terrorist organizations are actively plotting to cross the southwest border It remains to be seen whether DHS s facts permeate the right wing bubble After hearing the DHS statement  Sean Hannity claimed on his radio program that the agency could not be trusted and suggested it may be lying ",0,567

"Dogs DO go to heaven… and cats  and horses  Pope assures young boy that there is a place in paradise for animals as well Pope Francis has given hope to gays  unmarried couples and advocates of the Big Bang theory Now  he has endeared himself to dog lovers  animal rights activists and vegans Trying to console a distraught young boy whose dog had died  Francis told him in a recent public appearance on St  Peter’s Square that “paradise is open to all of God’s creatures ”
While it is unclear whether the pope’s remarks helped soothe the child  they were welcomed by groups such as the Humane Society and People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals  which saw them as a repudiation of conservative Catholic theology that says animals cannot go to heaven because they have no souls “My inbox got flooded ” said Christine Gutleben  senior director of faith outreach at the Humane Society  the largest animal protection group in the United States Charles Camosy  an author and a professor of Christian ethics at Fordham University  said it was difficult to know precisely what Francis meant  since he spoke “in pastoral language that is not really meant to be dissected by academics ”
But asked if the remarks had caused a new debate on whether animals have souls  suffer and go to heaven  Camosy said  “In a word  Absolutely ”
To some extent  it was not a surprise that Francis  an Argentine Jesuit who took his papal name from St  Francis of Assisi  the patron saint of animals  would suggest to a saddened child that his lost pet had a place in the afterlife Theologians cautioned that Francis had spoken casually  not made a doctrinal statement The Rev James Martin  a Jesuit priest and editor at large of America  the Catholic magazine  said he believed that Francis was at least asserting that “God loves and Christ redeems all of creation ” even though conservative theologians have said paradise is not for animals The question of whether animals go to heaven has been emotionally debated for much of the church’s history Pope Pius IX  who led the church from 1846 to 1878  strongly supported the doctrine that dogs and other animals have no consciousness Laura Hobgood Oster  professor of religion and environmental studies at Southwestern University in Georgetown  Texas  said  “Historically  the Catholic Church has never been clear on this question  it’s all over the place  because it begs so many other questions Where do mosquitoes go  for God’s sake ”",0,570
"Sick Mum Sedated After Trying To Eat Baby Nurses found the woman   who is believed to suffer mental health problems   biting her new son on the arm

Shocked medics have described the moment they found a mum apparently trying to EAT her baby days after he was born A nurse found the woman  named locally as 24 year old Li Zhenghua  with her jaws clamped firmly around the infant s arm She raised the alarm and tried to pull the baby free  but the mum refused to let go Doctors were forced to use an implement to prize her off the child before administering a sedative The shocking cannibalistic attack happened at a hospital in the city of Shenzhen in southern China’s Guangdong Province  where the woman had been discovered heavily pregnant and in labour on the street CEN   Investigation  Hospital bosses are now trying to decide whether to return the baby to the mother

She had been taken into the hospital and had given birth  and then placed in a ward where attempts had been made to contact her family as she was left to nurse the child However on the woman s third day in hospital  nurse Liu Tianlun had gone into the bedroom to find the young mother biting her son on the arm A hospital spokesman said   It was really shocking  the arm was badly damaged and suffered not only heavy bruising but bleeding as a result of the bite  Fortunately  doctors managed to insert something to stop her closing her teeth and then levered her jaws apart  After that they gave her a sedative and took the baby to a secure location CEN   Tragic  Doctors said the woman had been living on the street before she gave birth

Police said the woman had been identified as 24 year old Li Zhenghua They said enquiries had found that  despite being pregnant  her mother in law had thrown her out on the street after Li started behaving oddly The family did not alert anybody that Li was pregnant and might be in need of help She had apparently survived on the streets for at the very least several weeks and possibly longer before she was spotted in labour and the alarm was raised An investigation is now going on to decide what prompted the woman s actions and whether the child should be taken into the care of the authorities ",0,571

"Texas Plumber Has ‘No Idea’ How Company Truck Ended Up With ISIS What happened when Texas City plumbers put a black pickup truck up for auction more than a year ago This week  Mark Oberholtzer is among those trying to piece together the story An Islamic extremist group in Syria was photographed opening fire off of the back of that very same F 250 truck — the company’s name and phone number printed on the side — and that image is now circulating around the Internet A representative of Mr  Oberholtzer’s company  Mark 1 Plumbing Company  tells CBS News that the company lost track of the truck after selling it to an AutoNation dealership in Houston last year Were members of the Ansar al Deen Front – or their reps – operating in Texas buying used trucks Or was there a more indirect path Some observers have speculated that it must have taken many  many trades to get from the American South to the Middle East But Andrew Collins  who oversees Jalopnik com’s “Truck Yeah ” vertical  says the path from Texas to Syria may be shorter than some may think “If he traded it in  he would have no idea where it’s going ” Mr  Collins says “The highest bidder takes it  and they can do whatever they want ”

The truck could have been put on a cargo ship bound for a Middle East car dealer within days Car auctions  held several times each week  attract both used car dealers and exporters  he says Exporters comprise a small minority of auction attendees and purchase cars that  generally  are in worse condition than the ones that American used car dealers buy  Collins says  who has also written about the auto industry for The Christian Science Monitor Exporters then ship the cars overseas  where they are fixed up and resold “The next person to buy it could have been the exporter who sold it to the militants ” says Collins  who himself bid in auto auctions for a car dealership for about a year “I don’t know if ISIS has representatives in the car buying world — I don’t know anything about them But  exporters  could have shipped it to Syria and sold it to the people who mounted weapons on it It still would have been a few steps removed from the original seller  but I don’t think it had to be that complex ”

An AutoNation manager would not comment on the vehicle’s sale history to CBS News Oberholtzer tells the Galveston County Daily News that he received a thousand calls and faxes between Monday afternoon and Tuesday evening about the photo of his pickup truck Oberholtzer’s son  Jeff  tells ABC News that he has received threatening phone calls from around the country Call Mark 1 Plumbing for all your anti aircraft needs  https t co jVqhxvnij3

"Missing Libyan jetliners raise fears of terror attacks on 9 11 Islamist militias in Libya took control of nearly a dozen commercial jetliners last month  and western intelligence agencies recently issued a warning that the jets could be used in terrorist attacks across North Africa Intelligence reports of the stolen jetliners were distributed within the U S  government over the past two weeks and included a warning that one or more of the aircraft could be used in an attack later this month on the date marking the anniversary of the Sept  11  2001  terrorist attacks against New York and Washington  said U S  officials familiar with the reports “There are a number of commercial airliners in Libya that are missing ” said one official “We found out on September 11 what can happen with hijacked planes ”

The official said the aircraft are a serious counterterrorism concern because reports of terrorist control over the Libyan airliners come three weeks before the 13th anniversary of 9 11 attacks and the second anniversary of the Libyan terrorist attack on the U S  diplomatic compound in Benghazi Four Americans  including Ambassador Christopher Stevens  were killed in the Benghazi attack  which the Obama administration initially said was the result of a spontaneous demonstration against an anti Muslim video A senior State Department counterterrorism official declined to comment on reports of the stolen jetliners A second State department official sought to downplay the reports “We can’t confirm that ” he said Meanwhile  officials said Egyptian military forces appear to be preparing to intervene in Libya to prevent the country from becoming a failed state run by terrorists  many with ties to al Qaeda Libya remains an oil rich state and if the country is taken over completely by Islamist extremists  U S  counterterrorism officials believe it will become another terrorist safe haven in the region The officials said U S  intelligence agencies have not confirmed the aircraft theft following the takeover of Tripoli International Airport in late August  and are attempting to locate all aircraft owned by two Libyan state owned airline companies  as security in the country continued to deteriorate amid fighting between Islamists and anti Islamist militias Video surfaced on Sunday showing armed fighters from the Islamist militia group Libyan Dawn partying inside a captured U S  diplomatic compound in Tripoli The footage showed one fighter diving into a pool from a second story balcony at the facility Tripoli airport and at least seven aircraft were reported damaged during fighting that began in July Photos of the airport in the aftermath showed a number of damaged aircraft The airport has been closed since mid July The state owned Libyan Airlines fleet until this summer included 14 passenger and cargo jetliners  including seven Airbus 320s  one Airbus 330  two French ATR 42 turboprop aircraft  and four Bombardier CJR 900s Libyan state owned Afriqiyah Airways fleet is made up of 13 aircraft  including three Airbus 319s  seven Airbus 320s  two Airbus 330s  and one Airbus 340 The aircraft were reportedly taken in late August following the takeover of Tripoli International Airport  located about 20 miles south of the capital  by Libyan Dawn Al Jazeera television reported in late August that western intelligence reports had warned of terror threats to the region from 11 stolen commercial jets In response  Tunisia stopped flights from other Libyan airports at Tripoli  Sirte  and Misrata over concerns that jets from those airports could be on suicide missions Egypt’s government also halted flights to and from Libya Military forces in North Africa  including those from Morocco  Algeria  Tunisia  and Egypt have been placed on heightened alert as a result of intelligence warning of the stolen aircraft Egyptian military jets reportedly have conducted strikes inside Libya against Libyan Dawn positions recently  and U S  officials said there are signs a larger Egyptian military incursion is being planned Egyptian President Abdel Fatah al Sisi was quoted as denying Egyptian air strikes into Libya have taken place but suggested that military action is being considered Secretary of State John Kerry last week told his Egyptian counterpart that the United States would speed up the delivery of Apache attack helicopters  although it is not clear the Apaches would be used in any Libyan operations Egypt’s military backed government appears to be seeking a more significant role in regional security after the Obama administration helped engineer the ouster of Libyan strongman Moammar Qaddafi in 2011 Since then  the Obama  administration  through its announced policy of “leading from behind ” has stood by while Libya gradually has spiraled into chaos The Libyan government announced Sunday that it no longer controlled the capital of Tripoli “We announce that the majority of the ministries  institutions  and associations in the capital Tripoli are no longer under its control ” a government statement said Libya’s parliament in August declared both Ansar al Sharia and Libyan Dawn as terrorist organizations working to overthrow the government Ansar al Sharia  which is based in Benghazi  recently publicized on social media that it has obtained large numbers of more sophisticated weapons  including SA 6 surface to air missiles  anti aircraft guns  rocket propelled grenades  shoulder fired anti aircraft missiles  assault rifles  and armored vehicles The group is closely aligned with al Qaeda linked rebels in Syria Abderrahmane Mekkaoui  a Moroccan military expert  told Al Jazeera television  which first reported the airline theft Aug  21  the alert regarding the stolen jetliners was preventive and covers the region from Cairo to Lagos Nigeria Mekkaoui said the jets are being held by the Libyan group called Masked Men Brigade  which was designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the State Department in December The Masked Men Brigade is linked to al Qaeda and Ansar al Sharia—the group behind the Benghazi terrorist attacks of Sept  11  2012 Until the Libya Dawn takeover of the airport  announced Aug  24  two other militia groups  known as Al Qaqa and Al Sawa controlled the airport and all aircraft belonging to Libyan Airlines and Afriqiyah Airways Mekkaoui said “credible intelligence” reports given to states in the region indicated the Masked Men Brigade “is plotting to use the planes in attacks on a Maghreb state” on the 9 11 anniversary Counterterrorism expert Sebastian Gorka said that if the theft is confirmed  the stolen aircraft could be used in at least two ways “The first would be how commercial airliners were used on Sept  11  2001  literally turning an innocent mode of mass transit into a super high precision guided missile of immense potency ” said Gorka  who holds the Maj  Gen  Charles Horner chair at Marine Corps University in Quantico  Va 

“The second tactic could be to use the airframe with its civilian markings as a tool of deception to insert a full payload of armed terrorists into a locale that otherwise is always open to commercial carriers ” he said Michael Rubin  a counterterrorism specialist with the American Enterprise Institute  said commercial jetliners in the hands of terrorists could be formidable weapons “Who needs ballistic missiles when you have passenger planes Even empty  but loaded up with fuel they can be as devastating ” Rubin said “Each plane could  if deployed by terrorists to maximum devastating effect  represent 1 000 civilian casualties ”

Among the potential targets are urban areas and economic targets  like Saudi Arabia’s oil fields “Anyone who has ever flown over Saudi Arabia at night can see refineries like Yanbu lit up like Christmas trees against the blackness of the desert ” Rubin said “One Saudi security officer once told me that they would only have about 90 seconds to shoot down a hijacked plane from the time it left international airspace to impact in one of the region’s most important refineries ”

Rubin said in 2003 a Boeing 727 went missing in Africa fueling concerns about a terror attack on the U S  consulate in Karachi “What is striking is that more than a decade later  the United States hasn’t taken the need to safeguard what are effectively giant guided missiles seriously ” he said A former Libyan general  Khalifa Haftar  has been leading anti Islamist forces His group has access to Libyan air force MiG jets that have conducted strikes on Libyan Dawn positions in recent days Haftar also has conducted military raids in Benghazi The United Nations Security Council on Aug  27 announced plans for new sanctions on Libyan militias and terrorists In a resolution the U N  warned of the “growing presence of al Qaeda linked terrorist groups and individuals operating in Libya ”",0,595

"Real life Magneto boy  becomes living magnet  after getting massive electric shock from street lamp Nikolai Kryaglyachenko  12  now attracts coins  spoons and glasses to him   and had decided to become a superhero when he is older

A boy who was almost killed when he was knocked out by a huge electrical shock claims he has become a LIVING MAGNET with superpowers like those of Marvel s Magneto Nikolai Kryaglyachenko  12  was blasted across the pavement when he leant briefly against a lamppost that was live from a faulty wire  When I came round I felt groggy but managed to get home and told my mum what had happened  he said  When I woke up the next day and got out of bed I found some coins that had been lying on the mattress had stuck to my body  Then when I was having breakfast and dropped my spoon  it stuck to my chest Europics    Superpowers  Nikolai Kryaglyachenko wants to be a superhero when he grows up

Nikolai said he was a keen fan of comics and  believing that maybe he had developed some sort of super magnetic power to attract metal like Magneto  had decided to put it to the test  I can do things I couldn t do before but I don t have a lot of control over it  he said  Even when I do not want to do it  I still attract things  Once I even attracted a glass   it just moved towards me Nikolai added that he has now decided instead of a fireman he wants to be a superhero when he is older  saying that he would want to do something that helped people  and the job would certainly fulfil that role Europics   Look at me  Nikolai Kryaglyachenko  performs  for his classmates

He has also found himself one of the most popular boys at school with many of his classmates asking him to demonstrate his superpowers  and Nikolai even claims that he seems to be able to share his power According to his classmates  he can influence others so that other people turn into live magnets as well Nikolai s classmate  Vika Balandina  said   I could even hang a ladle on my nose Stories about  living magnets  began to appear at least in the middle of the 19th century In 2004  the story of a Russian factory worker Leonid Tenkaev and his family received extensive media coverage when he appeared to obtain the ability to attract objects after the Chernobyl nuclear disaster Europics   Cutlery collection  Nikolai Kryaglyachenko is a magnet for spoons and coins

Although people who have the ability to attract metal items are commonly referred to as  magnets  many of them can also hold plastic  glass  wood and paper items on their body Only some of them develop a  preference  for a particular material In 1990  as many as 300  living magnets  gathered for a conference in Sofia  the capital of Bulgaria  after young woman Marinela Brankova demonstrated her amazing ability on TV The woman could hold 7 kilos of metal on a vertical palm Scientists say however that rather than people being magnetic  it is probably nothing more than unusually sticky skin VIEW GALLERY",0,598

"Magic mushrooms found at Buckingham Palace The TV presenter was filming a programme in the Queen s gardens when he came across the fungi  which has hallucinogenic properties

A species of magic mushroom has been found growing in the grounds of BUCKINGHAM PALACE TV gardener Alan Titchmarsh was astounded when he came across the funny fungi while filming a Christmas special at the Queen s London home   saying   I won t be eating any of that The Amanita muscaria mushroom  commonly known as fly agaric or fly mushroom  is a white and red toadstool  with hallucinogenic properties The species contains poison which  in rare cases  can cause death if consumed Getty   Killer mushroom  The fly amanita contains poison which can be fatal

Presenter Alan told The Sun he was surprised to happen upon the plants while working on The Queen s Garden  which will be screened on Christmas Day  That was a surprise but it shows just how varied the species are  he said Fly agaric are common and are understood to have grown naturally in the palace grounds rather than having been planted there The hallucinogenic properties of the mushroom have been well known for centuries and have a long history of use in religious and shamanistic rituals  according to the Kew Gardens website PA   Surprise find  Alan Titchmarsh found the fungi while filming

The fungi is also important to the growth and development of many types of tree  and provides food for flies  and a breeding site for beetles A Buckingham Palace spokesperson said   There are several hundred fungi species in the palace garden  including a small number of naturally occurring fly agaric mushrooms  As the programme explains  they are beneficial to trees  increasing their ability to take in nutrients Royal officials also made clear for the record that fungi from the garden are not used in the palace kitchens ",0,600
"That s one way to get through security Frustrated traveller strips completely NAKED at airport to pass through metal detectors It is one of the most annoying aspects of modern air travel   kicking off shoes and removing belts to get through security without setting off the scanner One frustrated traveller clearly decided the only answer was to strip off altogether  much to the surprise of security guards The incident at Pulkovo Airport  in St Petersburg  Russia  saw the man strip his clothes off in a nonchalant manner before strolling through the metal detector watch by bemused airport workers Two guards can be seen chatting and looking on as the man bends down to remove his shoes and then starts to remove his belt Suddenly the man  who some sources believe may be an IT department worker at the airport  takes off his trousers altogether an places them in the tray with the rest of his belongings One security worker can be seen nudging his colleague and pointing to the man  but neither appears to know what to do next At first all seems as normal as the man bends down to remove his shoes   a common request by security when passing through metal detectors at airports

Suddenly the man surprises staff by removing his trousers altogether and placing them in a tray

As startled workers look on  seemingly unsure what to do  the man continues stripping off

Unbothered by the attention  the man moves onto his top half and whips off his jumper  leaving him completely naked But he still takes a moment to remove the all important wrist watch   the one thing that actually could set off the scanner   before strutting through the metal detecting arch Staff stand back and appear to let him just walk through the metal detectors The cheeky man even jokingly hesitate by the workers as if to check they don t want to search him further Completely unbothered by the attention  the man then strolls through the security gate  even pausing by security staff as if to ask if he needs to be searched further

The first thing the man puts back on is his wrist watch as he gathers his clothing up at the end of the conveyor belt

Then  as if there is nothing unusual about the situation  the man picks up his clothes   places his wrist watch back on first  then proceeds to walk off St Petersburg police are said to be investigating the incident Passengers at airports around the world have long complained of  invasive  searches at security points  with American passengers in particular complaining about the methods of the Transport Security Administration  TSA And instead of hurriedly getting changed  the man simply bundles up his clothes and walks off

It seems this gentleman isn t the first to stage a naked protest either In 2013  Lady Kelly Hadfield Hyde  51  and Ann Chadwick  48  stripped off at Manchester Airport security after sharing a bottle of wine The two were later sentenced for public order offences ",0,601

"Abdel Majed Abdel Bary in Foley beheading  London rapper songs help identify him Authorities say Bary has a similar accent to the man who beheaded US journalist James Foley British rapper Abde Majed Abdel Bary has been identified as the killer of American journalist James Foley Video of Foley’s beheading was released by ISIS last week FOX News reported 

American and British intelligence officials are eyeing a British born rapper as the militant who beheaded journalist James Foley A senior Western intelligence official told Fox News that 23 year old London rapper Abde Majed Abdel Bary is the suspect believed to be Foley’s executioner U S  intelligence officials are not commenting publicly on the reports  but a well placed source told Fox News that Bary’s Egyptian born father was extradited from London to the United States in 2012 for his alleged connection to Usama bin Laden and the 1998 U S  Embassy bombings in Africa Bary traveled to Syria last year to fight with ISIS  the source said The Sunday Times and Sunday People identified Bary as a member of a group of at least three British born ISIS fighters known among former hostages as “The Beatles ”

"IS Militants Kill 300 Iraqi Soldiers with Chlorine Gas Eleven Iraqi police officers were taken to hospital after an ISIS chemical weapons attack  with the Defense Ministry and doctors recently confirming the gas as chlorine This marks the first officially documented militant attack with the chemical The Islamic State  IS  formerly ISIS ISIL  militants’ chlorine gas attack occurred on September 15  in the town of Duluiyah  located north of the capital  according to a Washington Post report The blast followed an exchange of fire between the militants and the members of the Sunni Jabbour tribe  who were guarding the town’s borders “It was a strange explosion We saw yellow smoke in the sky ” said Lt  Khairalla al Jabbouri  one of the survivors The victims talked of the fog that hung close to the ground – a possible indication that it was chlorine  which is heavier than air The physicians who treated them also confirmed that their diagnosis was poisoning by chlorine gas “They were panicked  we were panicked ” said Kasim Hatim  director of the hospital in the nearby city of Balad  where the officers were taken “We initially thought it might be a more serious gas  a nerve gas or an organophosphate ”

A recent statement from the Iraqi Defense Ministry said that the IS had used the gas in a “primitive and ineffective way” – in roadside bomb attacks and near several water treatment plants where it had gained access to chlorine Without indicating the locations of the attacks  the statement said that the militants aimed at impairing “the morale of the Iraqi people in general and our armed forces in particular ”

American defense officials were not aware of the September 15 chlorine attack and referred to the Iraqi government for further information Alistair Baskey  spokesman for the National Security Council  told the New York Times on Thursday  “The use of chlorine as a chemical weapon is an abhorrent act These recent allegations underscore the importance of our work to eliminate chemical weapons in this volatile region ”

There have lately been several reports of IS militants using chlorine gas on the battlefield  however  none had been officially confirmed They appeared after the jihadists seized a large former Iraqi chemical weapons production plant this summer  whose 2 500 degraded rockets the Iraqi officials claimed unlikely to be fit for use Earlier this week  reports were circulating that there was a chemical attack in the besieged Syrian town of Kobani on Tuesday But the chemical agent the IS militants used couldn’t be identified  as doctors lacked necessary equipment to diagnose the cause of complaints made by Kurdish victims and activists As a choking agent  chlorine was widely used during World War I  Nowadays it is sold legally as a key component in industry  but its use as a chemical weapon violates the Chemical Weapons Convention ",0,604

Small Meteorite Strikes in Nicaragua s Capital City of Managua Nicaraguan officials have appealed for witnesses to a meteorite strike that left a 12m wide crater near Managua s international airport on Saturday night Residents reported a loud boom as the meteorite crashed but scientists said no one had come forward who had seen the streak that a speeding space rock would score across the sky  I was sitting on my porch and I saw nothing  then all of a sudden I heard a large blast  Jorge Santamaria told the Associated Press  We thought it was a bomb because we felt an expansive wave A government spokeswoman  Rosario Murillo  said a team formed to study the event believed the 5m deep crater was left by a relatively small meteorite that appeared to have come off an asteroid passing close to Earth She said international scientists had been called in to help with the investigation The meteorite may have been a fragment of a house sized asteroid nicknamed Pitbull  which hurtled past Earth on Sunday night at a distance of 40 000km Dan Brown  an astronomer at Nottingham Trent University  said that although the Nicaraguan impact occurred 12 hours before Pitbull passed Earth  Central America was facing the right direction for the strike to be a fragment associated with the asteroid Pieces of the asteroid could have broken off during collisions with other rocks in the asteroid belt or through heating when the asteroid swung around the sun  It certainly makes absolute sense that people surrounding the impact site heard a loud boom But a flash of light or bright object should also have been observed before that  Brown said Humberto Saballos  a volcanologist with the Nicaraguan Institute of Territorial Studies  told the AP it was unclear whether the meteorite disintegrated or was buried on impact at the site The meteorite could have exploded in the air and produced a shockwave that made the crater  or struck the ground and left small fragments embedded in the soil Witness accounts of the meteorite strike would help scientists confirm when the meteorite struck and the path it took – information that could link it to Pitbull or rule out the asteroid as the source of the rock Wilfried Strauch  an adviser to the Institute of Territorial Studies  said it was strange no one had reported a streak of light  We have to ask if anyone has a photo or something If investigators can find remnants of the meteorite in the crater  then its chemical makeup could be compared with measurements of the larger asteroid taken from ground based telescopes  It s a wake up call that we need to understand more about the flight paths of asteroids  Brown said ,0,608

"Missing Libyan jetliners raise fears of terror attacks on 9 11 Eleven planes missing from Tripoli Airport after it was taken by Islamic rebels

Fighters from group Libyan Dawn have posed for pictures with aircraft

U S  officials warn planes could be used to carry out terror attacks on 9 11

September 11 also marks anniversary of attack on US embassy in Libya

Libyan terrorists have posted pictures of themselves online posing with some of the aeroplanes taken from Tripoli airport after fighters seized it last month Soldiers from the group Libyan Dawn can be seen climbing on to the wings of commercial jets while smiling and waving for the camera U S  officials fear that these aeroplanes could now be used to carry out 9 11 style attacks in the region on the anniversary of the tragedy this month A total of 11 commercial jets from state owned carriers Libyan Airlines and Afriqiyah Airways went missing in August after militants from the so called  masked men brigade  overran the airport Scroll down for video

Islamists from the rebel group Libyan Dawn have posed with aeroplanes seized from Tripoli Airport last month

Authorities say 11 aircraft taken from Tripoli airport could now be used in terror attacks in the region

In pictures posted online Jihadi soldiers can be seen clambering over aircraft at Tripoli airport At least 11 planes went missing after the airport fell at the end of last month

Tripoli airport was left as little more than a smouldering ruin after rebels seized control of it in August

Officials have been warning for some time about the deteriorating situation in Libya  which was controlled by dictator Muammar Gaddaffi until he was killed in October 2011  There are a number of commercial airliners in Libya that are missing  one official told the Washington Free Beacon  We found out on September 11 what can happen with hijacked planes September 11 not only marks the anniversary of the attacks on the World Trade Center but it will also be the second anniversary of the raid of the U S Ambassador s compound in Benghazi  Libya Four Americans were killed in the attack  including U S Ambassador Christopher Stevens Ansar al Shariah  the group Washington holds responsible for the attack  have also seized parts of the Libyan capital and are known to work with terrorists from ISIS However they are not thought to be working with fighters from Libyan Dawn  as they are an Al Qaeda affiliated group The inside of the main building at Tripoli airport gutted by fire following an attack by Islamist militants

Images posted on Twitter show a fire raging inside one of the terminal buildings as militants attacked

Militias which once fought to oust Muammar Gaddaffi from power in 2011 are now warring between themselves for control of the volatile country

Libyan Dawn  an Al Qaeda affiliated group  are now in control of part of Tripoli  as are Ansar al Shariah  the group held responsible for the 2012 attack on the US embassy in Libya

Tripoli International Airport was being run by two anti Islamist militias and had been closed since mid July when it was taken over at the end of August by the group Libyan Dawn Pictures show the aftermath of the firefight  with planes completely or partially blasted and several littered with bullet holes Tripoli is witnessing one of its worst spasms of violence since Gaddaffi left power The militias  many of which originate from rebel forces that fought Gaddaffi  became powerful players in post war Libya  filling a void left by weak police and a shattered army Successive governments have put militias on their payroll in return for maintaining order  but rivalries over control and resources have led to fierce fighting among them and posed a constant challenge to the central government and a hoped for transition to democracy On Sunday  the Libyan government announced that they had lost control of the capital Ansar al Sharia has ties to the Islamic State  also known as ISIS  the Syrian group which today released the filmed beheading of American journalist Steven Sotloff   the second recorded execution of a U S  hostage by the group Fighters from Al Qaeda affiliated group Libyan Dawn pose on top of a heavily armoured truck as Tripoli Airport burns in the background following fighting there last month

Fears  Nearly a dozen commercial planes are missing in Libya after a radical Islamic group overtook the international airport in the capital of Tripoli late last month Aftermath  Tripoli International Airport was overtaken by the group Libyan Dawn last month and now 11 aircraft for Libyan Airlines and Afriqiyah Airways are missing

Moroccan military expert Abderrahmane Mekkaoui told Al Jazeera television after the airport attack that the planes had been taken by another Islamic group  the Masked Men Brigade Mekkaoui said there is  credible intelligence  that the Masked Men Brigade  is plotting to use the planes in attacks on the Maghreb state  on the 9 11 anniversary Sebastian Gorka  a counterterrorism expert  told the Free Beacon that the planes could be used in two ways to strike North Africa or even as far as the oil fields of Saudi Arabia  The first would be how commercial airliners were used on Sept 11  2001  literally turning an innocent mode of mass transit into a super high precision guided missile of immense potency  Gorka  the Maj Gen Charles Horner chair at the Marine Corps University  said Strike again A Moroccan military expert believes Islamic group The Masked Men Brigade are in control of the 11 missing airplanes

 The second tactic could be to use the airframe with its civilian markings as a tool of deception to insert a full payload of armed terrorists into a locale that otherwise is always open to commercial carriers  he added U S  officials have not publicly confirmed the eleven planes  disappearance  but are reportedly working to track them down Since the overthrow of previous dictator Muammar Gaddafi  Libya has descended into turmoil and officials fear it may become another safe haven for terrorists  like Syria Egypt s military government is currently looking into intervening in the country to restore order The U S  is taking a more conservative role in the country  but Secretary of State John Kerry said last week that he would be delivering Apache attack helicopters to Egypt ",0,616

"Turkish president says American weapons drop for Kurdish fighters was  wrong  after supplies end up in the hands of ISIS There it was in the middle of a field  baking in the sun  a cache of grenades  rockets and guns The trove was attached to a big black parachute and  as the camera focused in on the shipment  it seemed for a moment abandoned Then you see the masked man  who sermonized for the occasion An American airdrop of arms  he said  which had been intended for Kurdish fighters defending the city of Kobane  had fallen into the hands of the Islamic State “These are some of the American aid  items  that were dropped for the atheists in the” Kurdistan Workers’ Party ” the militant said in a video uploaded to jihadist social media accounts and initially reported by SITE Intelligence Group “Ammunition  military equipment  additional equipment — these are some of the military weapons The American forces dropped  them  … Praise be to Allah Spoils for the mujahideen ”

News of the accidental airdrop  which the Associated Press corroborated and the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights confirmed  brought fresh criticism to a military tactic — the air drop — officials said has become substantially more accurate in the past few decades  but is still evidently prone to screw ups And those screw ups have popped up several times so far in the battle against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria  underscoring the dangers of trusting the winds to carry valuable resources to their targets In early August  the U S  military dropped more than 7 000 gallons of water and 36 000 packaged meals onto a barren mountain near Sinjar  the hiding spot for nearly 40 000 Yazidis who fled the Islamic State under threat of genocide Many packages reached their intended targets — the Department of Defense estimated 80 percent — but not all of them did “Iraqi officials said that much of the U S  aid had been ‘useless’ because it was dropped from 15 000 feet without parachutes and exploded on impact ” wrote journalist Jonathan Krohn  who claimed to be the first Western journalist on the scene The Washington Post’s Liz Sly agreed  saying the drops “apparently went awry ”

Then NBC News reported late last month Iraqi military pilots accidentally dropped food  water and weapons to Islamic State fighters instead of to their own soldiers  who were battling to retain control of Anbar province “Some pilots  instead of dropping these supplies over the area of the Iraqi army  threw it over an area that is controlled by ISIS fighters ” Hakim al Zamili said  using another name for the Islamic State “Those soldiers were in deadly need of these supplies  but because of the wrong plans of the commanders in the Iraqi army and lack of experience of the pilots  we in a way or another helped ISIS fighters to kill our soldiers ”

Another general sheepishly added  “Yes  that’s what had happened ”

The embarrassing anecdotes feed into the complicated history of the airdrop  which still carries risks despite being honed over decades with technological advancements such as GPS guided parachutes “There’s no way you can predict who may end up with those weapons  and who is going to use them  or how they are going to use them ” Greg Myre of the Middle East Institute told the Daily Sabah “That is one of the risks you have to take ”

It was a risk Bill Clinton was willing to take in 1993 That was the year he ordered an airdrop of tens of thousands of humanitarian packages over eastern Bosnia  despite the “military consistently arguing against involving U S  troops in airdrops in hostile zones  given the fact that the accuracy of the drops is questionable ” the Associated Press then reported The brass turned out to be right One major problem laid bare during that mission  military scientists later said  was what they called “wind drift ” “The problem was identified in the late ’90s ” John McGinley  a scientist who researched the topic  told The Washington Post’s Holly Watt in 2008 “The terrain in Bosnia meant that instead of landing in one valley  the cargo could drift into another valley that was held by the enemy Wind drift was causing all the problems ”

So research teams got to work  ultimately unveiling wind forecast software that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said increased the drop’s accuracy by 70 percent “Inaccurate wind forecasts are the main culprit in missed targets for dropping supplies and other items from high altitudes ” the report said It almost immediately went into use in the war in Afghanistan  where far flung military outposts were separated by stretches of roads pockmarked with insurgents and explosives There had to be another way to get soldiers the equipment they needed  military officials thought  so they launched a massive increase in airdrops “We’ve gotten a lot more accurate over the years ” Air Force Gen  Arthur Lichte told USA Today That may true But following this week’s alleged delivery to the Islamic State  there’s clearly still room for work ",0,619

To call the Sugarhill Gang the “big bang” of hip hop diminishes the contributions of an entire community that imagined the music at its inception Big Bank Hank  after all  got his start in the business as a bouncer and managing an act that would become the Cold Crush Brothers He landed a spot in the Sugarhill Gang when the late music executive Sylvia Robinson tapped him to be part of a pop oriented rap trio she was putting together Jeff Chang’s essential history of hip hop  “Can’t Stop  Won’t Stop ” describes the song as standing out amid party oriented rap of the time due to the group’s birth as a studio creation Writes Chang  “Their raps on ‘Rapper’s Delight’ were the stuff that sounded good not in the parties  but on the live bootleg cassettes playing in the OJ cabs and on the boom boxes   the funny stories  the hookish slang  the same kind of stuff that would strike listeners around the world as both universal and new  not local and insular ”

“Rapper’s Delight” is considered the best selling 12 inch single of all time  though that’s tough to confirm in the pre Soundscan era  which began in 1991  and various litigation involving the track’s unapproved sampling of Chic’s “Good Times” further blurred the issue of numbers As happened with most first generation rap teams  and second  third  fourth  and fifth  Sugarhill Gang failed to sustain a bankable post hit career  and didn’t receive royalty checks equal to its influence In the years following the track s success  the style morphed in dozens of different directions  though  becoming politicized through Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five  electro fied through Afrika Bambaataa and popularized through Run DMC and the Beastie Boys Reverse engineer virtually any rap song since  and the circuitry leads back to  Rapper s Delight  and by extension  Big Bank Hank His phrasing  his fluid  funky tone  has endured  passed down from rapper to rapper  an invisible but essential presence Follow Randall Roberts on Twitter   liledit",0,621

Believed to be one of the largest of its kind ever caught  the creature was pulled from the river on Feb 19 with a rod and line after a battle lasting 40 minutes The nine foot long creature  a wels catfish  has been dubbed “the monster of the Po” by the Italian media The fish was released after the trophy photos  Sportex Italia 

After catching  weighing and photographing it  the brothers released it back into the river  which flows across northern Italy to the Adriatic “It’s a silurus glanis  the Latin name for the species ” Dino Ferrari said “The American catfish doesn’t grow to such large dimensions – at most it can weigh 50kg ” He estimated the fish to be about 30 years old  based on its size  adding that the species can live for up to 50 years “They don’t range over very large distances  they tend to live in the same stretch of river  moving just a few kilometres either way They eat all types of fish  To catch them you need a lot of patience but also physical strength We fought for 40 minutes to reel it in We tired it out and then lifted it out of the water ”

"A Wanted Man Responded To A Police Facebook Post That He Would Turn Himself In Over the weekend  the Canadian police force of Newfoundland and Labrador posted a “wanted” status on Facebook looking for Rodney Constantine  a man wanted for assault and some outstanding warrants Apparently  Rodney Constantine himself commented on the post and is planning to turn himself in Constantine let police know he’ll be coming in “Monday morn ” but the RNC police politely reminded him that their facilities are open 24 7 What proceeded was a weird and hilarious correspondence between police and Constantine in the comment section The RNC police told BuzzFeed News that they believe this is their guy  but he has yet to physically turn himself in “It’s hard to say if the person we found is the person  but it certainly seems that way ” Media Relations Officer Steve Curnew told BuzzFeed News Curnew also explained that they only turn to their social media outlets as a “last resort” if they can’t locate them by addresses on file While police are hopeful they have the right Rodney Constantine  “no one by that name has turned themselves in yet ”

This is not the first or even second time a suspect has identified themselves to Newfoundland cops on Facebook Curnew says he’s not surprised Constantine has so casually commented on his own wanted post on Facebook — this has been the case at least twice before “We’ve had it happen on one or two occasions that a person has contacted us ” Curnew explained to BuzzFeed News “When you send it out on social media  word comes around quick ”

He also pointed out that Constantine might not have known he was even wanted “The person sometimes isn’t aware they have outstanding warrants  He  may have just become aware that police are looking for him and he has nothing to hide ”

"Eyewitness Says Viral Video of Homeless Man Was Staged Last week  a heart warming social experiment video hit the web  showing a  secretly filmed  homeless man using an unexpected gift of  100 to buy food for others Since then  the almost too perfect clip has been featured everywhere from the L A  Times to Upworthy and generated over  130 000 on a donation page managed by the video s uploader  YouTube personality Josh Paler Lin According to a new eyewitness account  however  homeless star Thomas  knew he was being followed  and the  whole thing is bullshit  Bro   Lin  drove Thomas to the liquor store  26 year old Taugan Tan Kadalim told Vocativ  claiming he was on scene when the video s climax  now seen over 28 million times  was shot  While I think the guy is homeless  it is clear that from what I saw every part of that scene was staged From Vocativ 

The 26 year old says he stopped at the store to buy a lottery ticket before picking up his girlfriend  who lives in an apartment complex directly across the street As he was walking out of the liquor store  Kadalim says he spotted Lin sitting in the driver s seat of a nearby vehicle and recognized him immediately from his previous prank videos  I was like   Oh my God  it s him  says Kadalim  adding that he subscribed to Lin s YouTube channel  I couldn t believe it A cameraman sat in the passenger seat of Lin s car  and behind him was the man who Kadalim would later recognize as Thomas  the homeless Samaritan Lin claims was secretly followed with a hidden camera Thinking the three men were about shoot a prank video  Kadalim decided to stick around and watch Of course  given how many of this year s viral videos were hoaxes  staged or otherwise bullshit  it should hardly be surprising that this one might be too Unlike those videos  however  this one has six figures  purportedly to help Thomas  get a fresh start  in questionably controlled donations attached When pressed  Lin denied any part of his video had been staged or scripted  There is is no way we re making this up  Lin told Vocativ  This is real ",0,629
"Pictured  Heroic sergeant at arms  58  walking through Parliament gun in hand just moments after he killed gunman Michael Zehaf Bibeau He’s being called a hero for shooting a rampaging gunman dead on Parliament Hill — and it may mark the first time Sergeant At Arms Kevin Vickers has ever fired a gun in the line of duty “This the first time in his career that he’s shot anyone ” said Erin  Vickers’ niece A retired RCMP officer who once served in Calgary  58 year old Vickers is known to most Canadians as the symbol of order at the House of Commons  a grey haired man in a black hat and robes  often carrying the ceremonial sceptre of Canada over his shoulder On Tuesday  Vickers reportedly showed just how serious his role really is  the head of security for Canada’s government killing a gunman who charged into the Centre Block on Parliament Hill “To all in Ottawa  stay safe   strong Thank God for Sgt at Arms Kevin Vickers   our Cdn security forces True heroes…” Tweeted Minister Peter MacKay Julian Fantino  Canada’s Minister of Veterans Affairs  added his own Tweet of gratitude “I am safe   profoundly grateful to Sgt at Arms Kevin Vickers   our security forces for selfless act of keeping us safe ”

After the shooting  Vickers immediately contacted his family in New Brunswick to tell them he is safe — “I’m doing okay ” he said — but that hasn’t stopped them worrying about the emotional trauma that will follow  having being forced to pull the trigger for the first time “We’re always very proud of Kevin  but at this moment we are concerned about him — he had to make a very serious decision today ” said Mary  Vicker’s older sister “He’s always a natural leader — he would not have taken this decision lightly  and I can’t stress that enough — but he would always expect of himself to do what he would expect of the men and women under him ”

Raw footage of the Centre Block attack show officers and guards moving cautiously down the hall  before gunfire suddenly erupts  with dozens of shots echoing in the distance Various witnesses have credited Vickers with leading the security response and killing the infiltrator  a man who may have been the same cold blooded murderer who gunned down an unarmed solider outside the national cenotaph moments before Anyone who thought Canada’s Sergeant At Arms role was an archaic novelty now understands the man holding the sceptre has a deadly serious job “It’s not ceremonial at all  and he has tremendous responsibility — and he wears it well ” said Mary In an RCMP career spanning 29 years  Vickers rose up the ranks from a constable in the Northwest Territories to serving ten years in Alberta  and then to chief superintendent in Ottawa After retiring from the force  he took the Sergeant At Arms job on Parliament Hill  and was once famously photographed escorting a protestor masquerading as a page from the House of Commons His niece Erin says her uncle is a calm  gentle man — but someone who handles pressure with utmost calm “He’s a thoughtful and considerate person — he’s halfway to a saint in my opinion ” she said “He’s a very capable human being ”

"Obama denounces killing of journalist James Foley and pledges ‘justice’ President Obama said Wednesday that the United States “will be vigilant and we will be relentless” against Islamic State militants and would “do what’s necessary to see that justice is done” following the videotaped execution of an American journalist “Today the entire world is appalled at the brutal murder of James Foley by the terrorist group ISIL ” Obama said  using one of several acronyms for the group The militants  who posted the video on YouTube Tuesday  said Foley’s killing was in retaliation for U S  airstrikes in Iraq Obama  who spoke Wednesday morning to Foley’s parents  offered no new policy measures to confront Islamic State Referring to neighboring countries and U S  allies  he said “there has to be a common effort to extract this cancer so that it does not spread ”

Asked whether the United States might consider suspending its airstrikes  one U S  official said the “only question is if we do more ” Officials said that attacks against the Islamic State would continue in Iraq under an authorization Obama signed early this month Obama could face pressure to escalate the air campaign in Iraq and increase support to U S backed rebels in Syria who are fighting against the Islamic Front  as well as Syrian President Bashar al Assad Obama has resisted pleas from the Syrian rebels for U S  heavy weapons  including portable surface to air missiles  as well as for American air support In a statement issued after the president’s remarks  Rep  Ed Royce  R Calif  chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee  said  “We must get serious about confronting this force  including by aggressively arming those battling it ”

The White House confirmed early Wednesday that U S  intelligence had deemed the video authentic Obama spoke in Martha’s Vineyard  where he is vacationing with his family Foley  a 40 year old New Hampshire native and a photojournalist working for the Boston based Web site Global­Post  was kidnapped in northern Syria nearly two years ago while covering the civil war in Syria In Britain Wednesday  Prime Minister David Cameron cut short a family vacation and returned to London to chair emergency meetings on Iraq and Syria  amid indications that a British citizen was involved in Foley’s killing In the video  his masked executioner speaks in English with what sounds like a British accent After beheading Foley  the executioner is pictured with a second captive  identified as U S  freelance journalist Steven Joel Sotloff  who disappeared last year in Syria “The life of this American citizen  Obama  depends on your next decision ” the executioner says In an interview with the BBC  British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond acknowledged that the executioner spoke with a British accent and said the video seemed to be genuine Hundreds of Britons are believed to have traveled to Syria to fight in the country’s civil war  including many who have joined the Islamic State “We’re absolutely aware that there are significant numbers of British nationals involved in terrible crimes  probably in the commission of atrocities ” Hammond said “Many of these people may seek at some point to return to the U K  and they would then pose a direct threat to our domestic security ”

A European intelligence official said the British government was examining the video  and the speech of the purported executioner  to compare it to the speech of former Guantanamo Bay prisoners and other British residents believed to have joined the Islamic State Both prisoners in the video are wearing orange shirts and pants  similar to orange jumpsuits worn by detainees at the U S  military prison at Guantanamo Bay  Cuba A similar outfit  believed to be a jihadist symbol of the prison  was worn by Nicholas Berg  an American businessman kidnapped in Iraq in 2004 whose execution by an Islamic State precursor organization was recorded on video and posted online Foley  40  was working in Syria for the Boston based news Web site Global­Post when he disappeared on Thanksgiving in 2012 In a statement Tuesday night on a Facebook page dedicated to his freedom  Foley’s mother wrote  “We have never been prouder of our son Jim ” Diane Foley wrote “He gave his life trying to expose the world to the suffering of the Syrian people “We implore the kidnappers to spare the lives of the remaining hostages Like Jim  they are innocents They have no control over American government policy in Iraq  Syria or anywhere in the world ”

Praising James Foley as “an extraordinary son  brother  journalist and person ” she asked that the family’s privacy be respected In addition to Foley and Sotloff  at least three other Americans are believed to be captives in Syria  according to a 2013 Global­Post article  including Austin Tice  a freelance journalist whose articles appeared in McClatchy publications and The Washington Post before his disappearance in August 2012 No one has claimed to be holding them According to the Committee to Protect Journalists  at least 66 journalists  all but 10 of them Syrian  have been killed covering the Syrian war If the video is authenticated  Foley would be the first American journalist known to be executed since the conflict began in early 2011 The video evoked the 2002 taped execution in Pakistan of Wall Street Journal correspondent Daniel Pearl by al Qaeda The Islamic State  an offshoot of al Qaeda  is the most powerful among a number of extremist organizations that have emerged during the Syrian civil war  which began as a popular uprising against President Bashar al Assad Fighting against both Assad and U S backed rebels  the militants now control much of eastern Syria and claim to have established an Islamic caliphate spanning Syria and neighboring Iraq As the group has grown  it has merged with the group formerly known as al Qaeda in Iraq  under the leadership of Abu Bakr al Baghdadi According to U S  intelligence  it numbers in the thousands  including foreign fighters from Europe and the United States In April  Islamic State fighters swept across the border into northern Iraq  taking over the city of Mosul before moving southward to within 60 miles of Baghdad Extensive reports of executions  including beheadings and crucifixions  have emerged from areas under the group’s control This month  amid reports of stranded and besieged Iraqi minorities threatened with execution  the militants advanced eastward toward Irbil  the capital of the semiautonomous Kurdish region of Iraq On Aug  7  Obama authorized U S  airstrikes to rescue stranded minorities and protect U S  personnel and facilities in Irbil and Baghdad On Monday  after a total of 68 strikes from jets  bombers and drones  Obama announced that Iraqi and Kurdish forces  with U S  air support  had retaken a strategic dam north of Mosul from the militants and that they had been pushed back from Irbil Within hours of that announcement  the Islamic State posted an online message warning it would attack Americans “in any place” in response to the airstrikes “We will drown all of you in blood ” it said The title of the video posted Tuesday was “A Message to America” and was produced by the Islamic State’s media arm  according to the Site Intelligence Group  which monitors extremist Web sites A masked man dressed in black is shown standing in an unidentified desert location beside a prisoner kneeling beside him with his hands behind his back “Obama authorized military operations against the Islamic State effectively placing America upon a slippery slope towards a new war against Muslims ” the masked man says The video then shows a clip of Obama’s Aug  7 announcement  followed by a statement from the prisoner “I call on my friends  family and loved ones to rise up against my real killers  the U S  government  for what will happen to me is only a result of their complacent criminality ” he says He asks his parents not to accept “any meager compensation from the same people who effectively hit the last nail in my coffin with the recent aerial campaign in Iraq ”

The prisoner also appeals to “my brother John  who is a member of the U S  Air Force ” to “think about what you are doing ”

“I wish I had more time ” he says “I wish I could have the hope for freedom to see my family once again  but that ship has sailed I guess all in all  I wish I wasn’t an American ”

"Managua explosion not a meteorite  NASA suggests Experts have raised doubts about whether a loud boom and a gaping crater found in Nicaragua s crowded capital Managua this weekend were caused by a meteorite  as the government has said The impact near the international airport did not cause any known injuries  but it did leave a crater measuring 12 metres across and was felt throughout the capital The US National Aeronautics and Space Administration on Monday said that while a meteorite could not be ruled out  the lack so far of any eyewitness accounts of a fireball lighting up the nighttime sky outside Managua on Saturday suggests something else was likely behind the event Bill Cooke  head of NASA s Meteoroid Environment Office  estimated that the crater would have been created by a blast of roughly an energy equivalent of 1 ton of TNT NASA said in a statement that a meteor capable of that would have created a ball of flame visible over a wide area About 1 5 million people live in the Nicaraguan capital  For something to produce a hole in the ground that big  it would have generated a very bright fireball And nothing was reported   despite the population  Cooke said  So I m very sceptical Nicaraguan authorities believe it was a piece of the small asteroid dubbed  2014 RC  which passed very close to Earth and was estimated by astronomers to be about 20 meters big  or the size of a house  Fascinating event 

Government officials and experts visited the impact site on Sunday One of them  William Martinez  said it was not yet clear if the meteorite burned up completely or if it had been blasted into the soil  You can see mirror like spots on the sides of the crater from where the meteorite power scraped the walls  Martinez said Government spokeswoman  First Lady Rosario Murillo  said Nicaraguan authorities would be in contact with the US Geological Service to try to get more information about  this fascinating event  in the Central American nation  one of Latin America s poorest countries People who live near the crater told local media they heard a blast they took for an explosion  and that liquid  sand and dust were blown through the air  which smelled like something had burned There were no reported injuries because the impact was in a wooded spot  and flights at the airport were not affected ",0,637

"NASA Raises Doubts About Reports of Nicaraguan Meteorite An explosion and a crater reported near the capital of Nicaragua raised suspicions on Monday that a meteorite had split off from an asteroid that passed by Earth this weekend and struck our planet But NASA scientists have now cast doubt on whether the blast outside Managua was even a meteorite at all The blast left a hole 40 feet  12 meters  wide and 19 feet  5 meters  deep outside the international airport serving Nicaragua s capital Some Nicaraguan astronomers quoted in early news reports attributed the blast to a chip off a weekend asteroid flyby But outside meteorite experts later downplayed links to the small asteroid  dubbed 2014 RC  which passed harmlessly by Earth over the weekend About the size of a house  2014 RC passed within 22 000 miles  36 000 kilometers  of our planet on Sunday  Information is limited  but the miss distance of 2014 RC actually precludes any related meteorite impact  at the Managua crater  says MIT asteroid expert Richard Binzel  by email Managua Meteorite Managua residents reported the blast just after midnight In some news reports  geophysicist Wilfried Strauch of Nicaragua s Institute of Earth Studies attributed the crater to a meteorite impact However  NASA asteroid expert Don Yeomans  author of Near Earth Objects  Finding Them Before They Find Us  says that outside experts suspect the crater wasn t caused by an impact  This event was separated by 13 hours from the close Earth approach of 2014 RC  so the explosion and the asteroid are unrelated  says Yeomans  because the Earth moves about 870 000 miles  1 4 million kilometers  in 13 hours  There was no obvious optical fireball or debris trail seen prior to the explosion  so it seems unlikely that the explosion in Nicaragua was related to a meteorite impact Russian Roulette

"Accused Boston Marathon Bomber Severely Injured In Prison  May Never Walk Or Talk Again FORT DEVENS  Massachusetts  

Infamous Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev  21  was the victim of an “unfortunate accident” yesterday at Ft  Devens Detention Center in Massachusetts  just weeks after his high profile trial began  according to warden Paul Jacobson Corrections officers reportedly found the alleged terror suspect face down in a pool of his own blood in his cell  a banana peel was found on the floor nearby “It initially appeared as though Tsarnaev slipped on a discarded banana peel and hit the floor with such force that his head bounced off the hard tile surface  probably 16 or 17 times There was blood everywhere – all over the walls  the floor  even the toilet The injuries have caused massive brain trauma ” said prison investigator Joe Goldsmith “We determined though  through expert analysis  that it would be impossible for these injuries to have occurred through a fall Our investigation has shown that that it was the Aryan Brotherhood who initiated an attack on Tsarnaev ”

“Yes  it was the brotherhood who took care of that bomber ” said Miles Smith  head of the Aryan Nation inside Devens “The other gangs  they wanted him  too We paid the guards the most money to have a shot They stood aside  and let us do what we do On the way out  they shook our hands  told us ‘Thank you ’ Well  You’re welcome You’re welcome  Boston You’re welcome  America ”

“Normally  an attack this violent  this cruel  on another inmate would get any offending party more time added to their sentence ” said warden Jacobson “Because of the nature of Tsarnaev’s crimes  though  we have decided to actually reduce the sentences of the Aryan members who were involved They have done our prison and our country a great service  and we appreciate it immensely They are heroes in the eyes of not only this institution  but also in the eyes of the people of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts ”

"Obama  murder of James Foley  shocks the conscience of the entire world  In a horrifying act of revenge for U S  airstrikes in northern Iraq  militants with the Islamic State extremist group have beheaded American journalist James Foley — and are threatening to kill another hostage  U S  officials say The White House must now weigh the risks of adopting an aggressive policy to destroy the Islamic State against resisting any action that could result in the death of another American It will also confront the potentially necessary step of pursuing the Islamic State in Syria  where President Barack Obama has resisted launching airstrikes or deploying significant American firepower Obama was expected to make a statement Wednesday about Foley s killing U S  officials confirmed a grisly video released Tuesday showing Islamic State militants beheading Foley Separately  Foley s family confirmed his death in a statement posted on a Facebook page that was created to rally support for his release  saying they  have never been prouder of him  He gave his life trying to expose the world to the suffering of the Syrian people  said the statement  which was attributed to Foley s mother  Diane Foley She implored the militants to spare the lives of other hostages  Like Jim  they are innocents They have no control over American government policy in Iraq  Syria or anywhere in the world Foley  40  from Rochester  New Hampshire  went missing in northern Syria in November 2012 while freelancing for Agence France Presse and the Boston based media company GlobalPost The car he was riding in was stopped by four militants in a contested battle zone that both Sunni rebel fighters and government forces were trying to control He had not been heard from since The beheading marks the first time the Islamic State has killed an American citizen since the Syrian conflict broke out in March 2011  upping the stakes in an increasingly chaotic and multilayered war The killing is likely to complicate U S  involvement in Iraq and the Obama administration s efforts to contain the group as it expands in both Iraq and Syria The group is the heir apparent of the militancy known as al Qaida in Iraq  which beheaded many of its victims  including American businessman Nicholas Berg in 2004 The video released on websites Tuesday appears to show the increasing sophistication of the Islamic State group s media unit and begins with scenes of Obama explaining his decision to order airstrikes It then cuts to a balding man in an orange jumpsuit kneeling in the desert  next to a black clad militant with a knife to his throat Foley s name appears in both English and Arabic graphics on screen After the captive speaks  the masked man is shown apparently beginning to cut at his neck  the video fades to black before the beheading is completed The next shot appears to show the captive lying dead on the ground  his head on his body The video appears to have been shot in an arid area  there is no vegetation to be seen and the horizon is in the distance where the sand meets the gray blue sky At the end of the video  a militant shows a second man  who was identified as another American journalist  Steven Sotloff  and warns that he could be the next captive killed Sotloff was kidnapped near the Syrian Turkish border in August 2013  he had freelanced for Time  the National Interest and MediaLine One U S  official said the video appeared to be authentic  and two other U S  officials said the victim was Foley All three officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the killing by name Several senior U S  officials with direct knowledge of the situation said the Islamic State very recently threatened to kill Foley to avenge the crushing airstrikes over the past two weeks against militants advancing on Mount Sinjar  the Mosul dam and the Kurdish capital of Irbil Both areas are in northern Iraq  which has become a key front for the Islamic State as its fighters travel to and from Syria Since Aug  8  the U S  military has struck at least 70 Islamic State targets — including security checkpoints  vehicles and weapons caches It s not clear how many militants have been killed in the strikes  although it s likely that some were The Islamic State militant group is so ruthless in its attacks against all people they consider heretics or infidels that it has been disowned by al Qaida s leaders In seeking to impose its harsh interpretation of Islamic law in the lands it is trying to control  the extremists have slain soldiers and civilians alike in horrifying ways — including mounting the decapitated heads of some of its victims on spikes The New York based Committee to Protect Journalists estimated Tuesday that about 20 journalists are missing in Syria  and has not released their nationalities In its annual report in November  the committee concluded that the missing journalists were either being held and threatened with death by extremists  or taken captive by gangs seeking ransom The group s report described the widespread seizure of journalists as unprecedented and largely unreported by news organizations in the hope that keeping the kidnappings out of public view may help in the captives  release

"BREAKING NEWS  ISIS beheads missing American journalist James Wright Foley as warning to US to cease action in Iraq President Obama declared that the entire world was “appalled” by the beheading of an American journalist by militants in Syria  but vowed that America would not change course in Iraq  where the United States has been conducting airstrikes against terrorists  despite threats by the group to kill another reporter in the days ahead “The United States of America will continue to do what we must do to protect our people ” Mr  Obama said in a brief statement from Martha’s Vineyard  where he was vacationing “We will be vigilant and we will be relentless ”

Before speaking to reporters  Mr  Obama said he placed a phone call to the parents of James Foley  the slain reporter  telling them that Americans were “are all heartbroken at their loss ” He described Mr  Foley as a “journalist  a son  a brother and a friend who was “taken from us in an act of violence that shocked the conscience of the entire world ”

But the president’s harshest and most emotional words were reserved for the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria  the militants who released a video of the killing of Mr  Foley on Tuesday American intelligence agencies on Wednesday verified the authenticity of the video  which shows a masked man decapitating James Foley  an American journalist who was kidnapped in Syria nearly two years ago It also shows another American captive  the journalist Steven Sotloff  and warns that he would be the next to die The president called ISIS a “cancer” in the region and accused them of having “rampaged across cities and villages  killing unarmed civilians in cowardly acts of violence ” He said it had committed torture and rape against innocent women and children and continued to enslave those they did not kill “No faith teaches people to massacre innocents ” Mr  Obama said “No just God would stand for what they did yesterday and what they do every single day People like this ultimately fail They fail because the future is won by people who build and not destroy ”

The killing of Mr  Foley triggered a fierce response The New York Daily News and The New York Post both used the same banner headline on their front pages  “Savages ” Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain released a statement saying “the brutal murder of James Foley is shocking and depraved ”

At the United Nations  Secretary General Ban Ki moon issued a statement condemning ISIS for “the horrific murder of journalist James Foley  an abominable crime ” Mr  Ban said “the perpetrators of this and other such horrific crimes must be brought to justice ”

Is Snyder taking a sly  friendly dig at J J  Abrams and the currently filming Star Wars  Episode VII It would seem so  but what if Snyder had used  say  a Joker or Two Face lookalike – or at least one of their henchmen The internet would’ve imploded This way  Snyder provides fans with a harmless bit of franchise crossover in the form of this officially sanctioned bit of fan fiction The attention to detail is pretty funny  too – the way the Gotham PD cop nearest the Batmobile is looking at the Stormtrooper’s blaster is priceless Make no mistake  Zack Snyder is following the online fan chatter He’s not above calling in to a Detroit radio show to defend Aquaman’s badassery and  apparently  will comment on your Instagram video when the mood takes him CBM caught Snyder’s now deleted comment   “Watching you”   on the following video taken by IG user  danielblane  who was home one night while the Batmobile did burnouts on the neighboring Batman v Superman set 
Snyder  whose Instagram handle is  cruelfilms  has removed his comment  but judging by the reaction of the video’s other commenters  the fact that Snyder has weighed in at all delights them to no end The fact that the director takes the time to interact with his fans is genuinely heartening for audience members who may have questioned the decision to hand Snyder not just an all new Superman and Batman  but Warner Bros  and DC’s own interconnected movie universe The leaked BvS set pictures and videos still don’t answer any of the bigger questions about the film’s plot and whether or not it will be able to seamlessly integrate multiple superheroes while giving us a satisfying first time team up of the World’s Finest  but that won’t stop us from poring over every image from Detroit that we can get our hands on Batman v Superman  Dawn of Justice will open in theaters on March 25  2016 Source  Instagram  Zack Snyder  Bleeding Cool",0,671

"Norfolk Man Pays £300 For His Constipated Goldfish To Have Lifesaving Surgery A devoted pet owner has spent £300 on saving the life of his goldfish after it became constipated The man  who has not been named  took the fish to a veterinary practice in North Walsham  Norfolk  after noticing it was struggling to eliminate waste He had hoped it would be a simple procedure but was told by staff at the Toll Barn Veterinary Centre that the delicate surgery required to save his pet would cost £300 The company boss initially turned down the treatment but changed his mind 10 minutes later and went back to give the go ahead Scroll down for video

The pet owner  who has not been named  took his goldfish  pictured  to Toll Barn Veterinary Centre in North Walsham  Norfolk  and paid £300 for it to have a special operation after noticing it had become constipated

Vet Faye Bethell  29  put anaesthetising agent into the fish s water before using tiny instruments to remove two lumps from its body The three inch pet went on to make a full recovery after the 50 minute operation

Vet Faye Bethell  29  was then tasked with carefully administering anaesthetic before using tiny instruments to remove a lump close to the fish s backside A second lump was removed from his dorsal fin before the fish was returned to water and handed back to his grateful owner Ms Bethell said the three inch fish made a full recovery after the 50 minute operation and said it would have died if it was left untreated She said   I have never done a procedure like that on a goldfish  although I have done it before on more valuable fish like a carp Vet Faye Bethell  29  pictured  carried out the delicate £300 operation on the constipated goldfish

 The actual surgery is quite straightforward but administering the anaesthetic is quite complicated  The issue was the fish couldn t poo and it would have eventually become toxic and it would have died  There was nothing special about the fish He just liked it a lot People love their pets   but that was an expensive little goldfish The delicate procedure involved introducing a carefully measured anaesthetising agent into the fish s water It was then removed from its tank and placed on a waterproof drape before anaesthetic water was put into its mouth via a tube and bubbled over its gills Ms Bethell then used a miniature heart rate monitor to check that the fish was properly  under  before using a mini scalpel to remove the lumps She then sewed each cut with three stitches before using a special  glue  to cover and waterproof the fish s scales before it was gradually re awakened Goldfish can live up to 10 years and this ailing pet was two years and 10 months old at the time of its operation The Toll Barn practice opened a year ago and specialises in exotic animals as well as the more usual pets Ms Bethell revealed that in the past year she has carried out a string of bizarre operations including the removal of a 12g skin tumour from a two inch long hognose snake She has also successfully taken out a stone from the 5mm wide ureter of a guinea pig and last week castrated a skunk Earlier this year  Melbourne veterinarian Dr  Tristan Rich  pictured    head of exotics and wildlife medicine at Lort Smith Animal Hospital   performed micro surgery on a goldfish called George to remove a cancer tumour

The 10 year old goldfish had a large tumour on his head  making it difficult for him to breathe and swim

During the  fiddly  operation  the tumour   which had stretched down to the fish s skull   was cut out  pictured 

It is not the first time a goldfish has undergone a traumatic operation to save its life Earlier this year  Melbourne veterinarian Dr  Tristan Rich   head of exotics and wildlife medicine at Lort Smith Animal Hospital   performed micro surgery on a goldfish called George The 10 year old pet had a large tumour on his head  making it difficult for him to breathe and swim He was also unable to eat properly  and the tumour was affecting his ability to see His owners had been monitoring the growth of the tumour which was sprouting from his head  and decided to opt for the surgery which cost  200  £105 During the  fiddly  operation  the tumour   which had stretched down to the fish s skull   was delicately cut out ",0,678

The dog is microchipped and we were able to find out his name is Kai We contacted the owner registered to the microchip  who stated they had sold Kai on Gumtree in 2013 Unfortunately they could not tell us the address of the person who bought him This case highlights the potential consequences of selling an animal online as it often leads to the impulse buying of pets that people know very little about Regardless of the fact Kai was left with his belongings  this was still a cruel incident and we are keen to identify the person responsible If anyone can help we would ask them to get in touch as soon as possible Kai is around two to three years old and is a lovely dog with a nice nature We will look after him until we can find him a permanent and loving home ",0,680

"No  that high school kid didn t make  72 million trading stocks It’s been a tough month for factchecking After the Rolling Stone campus rape story unraveled  readers of all publications can be forgiven for questioning the process by which Americans get our news And now it turns out that another blockbuster story is —to quote its subject in an exclusive Observer interview—”not true ”

Monday’s edition of New York magazine includes an irresistible story about a Stuyvesant High senior named Mohammed Islam who had made a fortune investing in the stock market Reporter Jessica Pressler wrote regarding the precise number  “Though he is shy about the  72 million number  he confirmed his net worth is in the “’high eight figures ’” The New York Post followed up with a story of its own  with the fat figure playing a key role in the headline  “High school student scores  72M playing the stock market ”

And now it turns out  the real number is … zero In an exclusive interview with Mr  Islam and his friend Damir Tulemaganbetov  the baby faced boys who dress in suits with tie clips came clean Swept up in a tide of media adulation  they made the whole thing up Speaking at the offices of their newly hired crisis pr firm  5WPR and handled by a phalanx of four including the lawyer Ed Mermelstein of RheemBell Mermelsein  Mr  Islam told a story that will be familiar to just about any 12th grader—a fib turns into a lie turns into a rumor turns into a bunch of mainstream media stories and invitations to appear on CNBC Here’s how it happened Observer  What was your first contact with the New York magazine reporter Mohammed Islam  “My friend’s father worked at New York magazine and he had the reporter contact me Then she  Jessica Pressler  called me ”

You seem to be quoted saying “eight figures ” That’s not true  is it No  it is not true The Post trumpeted the boys  investment success  as did New York magazine  screencap 
The Post trumpeted the boys’ investment success  as did New York magazine  screencap 

Is there ANY figure Have you invested and made returns at all No So it’s total fiction Yes Are you interested in investing How did you get this reputation I run an investment club at Stuy High which does only simulated trades ”

If you had been playing with real money  would you have done really well The simulated trades percentage was extremely high relative to the S P Where did Jessica Pressler come up with the  72 million figure I honestly don’t know The number’s a rumor She said ‘have you made  72 million’  I led her to believe  I had made even more than  72 million on the simulated trades At this point the PR reps jumped in with Law   Order style objections A conference outside the room ensued Back into the room came Mr  Islam All I can say is for the simulated trades  I was very successful The returns were incredible and outperformed the S P Damir  tell me where you fit into this Damir Tulemaganbetov  Well  I got excited by this whole trading thing and I said hey  let me get on board I heard about this article coming out and Mohammed invited me and I met Jessica But you guys are pals outside of this We go to social gatherings and friends’ places Are you into stockpicking as well I haven’t been into it but I’m interested Mohammed  you’re from Queens and you go to this elite public high school Is this a hobby of your parents as well or would you be the first person in your family to pursue high finance Mohammed Islam  In my immediate family  just me So what did your parents think when they’re reading that you’ve got  72 million Mohammed Islam  Honestly  my dad wanted to disown me My mom basically said she’d never talk to me Their morals are that if I lie about it and don’t own up to it then they can no longer trust me … They knew it was false and they basically wanted to kill me and I haven’t spoken to them since You haven’t Where did you sleep last night Mohammed Islam  At a friend’s house But we didn’t sleep Damir Tulemaganbetov  We stayed awake all night We’ve been checking out news all over the world Are your friends blowing up your phones Damir Tulemaganbetov  He had 297 unread messages and 190 LinkedIn All the friends shared it Mohammed Islam  It was hyped up beyond belief Damir Tulemaganbetov  We were at CNBC That’s why we’re dressed up But we were there and literally in the building stressing out We had 20 minutes Then we three times asked them could we have 20 seconds to talk  The boys ended up cancelling the CNBC appearance Where do you go from here Damir Tulemaganbetov  Socially  people will be mad about it But we’re sorry Especially ot our parents Like my dad would read this and be like ‘Oh My God’ because he’s a very humble man and I portrayed him like a bad father Mohammed Islam  At school  first things first I am incredibly sorry for any misjudgment and any hurt I caused The people I’m most sorry for is my parents I did something where I can no longer gain their trust I have one sister  two years younger  and we don’t really talk So that’s that There was no  72 million  no “eight figures ” not even one figure The story is already coming unglued as the commenters on New York’s site hammer the reporter for even thinking this was possible New York has now altered its headline to back away from the  72 million figure but the story itself remains Even if this working class kid had somehow started with  100 000 as a high school freshman on day one at Stuy High  he’d have needed to average a compounded annualized return of something like 796  over the three years since C’mon  man It’s not hard to see why the story was tough to resist for New York  which placed Mr  Islam’s alleged acumen at No 12 in its 10th annual “Reasons to Love New York” issue Ms  Pressler quoted him saying  “It’s not just about money We want to create a brotherhood Like  all of us who are connected  who are in something together  who have influence  like the Koch brothers …” Yep  nothing says success—or search engine optimization—quite like “Koch brothers ”

No one asked for my opinion  but I’m going to provide it anyway  having sat with these kids for a good bit on a tough day They got carried away They’re not children But they’re not quite adults  either  and at least Mr  Islam was literally quaking as we spoke So yeah  they probably should have known better But New York and the New York Post probably should have  as well This story smelled fishy the instant it appeared and a quick dance with the calculator probably would have saved these young men—and a couple reporters—some embarrassment The Stuyvesant High School classmates stayed up all night as the crisis grew  5WPR

"Pants on Fire  Duncan Hunter makes unconfirmed claim Border Patrol caught at least 10 ISIS fighters U S  Rep  Duncan Hunter this week declared terrorists have been crossing the Rio Grande The California Republican  speaking to Greta Van Susteren on Fox News Oct  7  2014  said he’d learned from the U S  Border Patrol that Islamic State fighters had been nabbed trying to enter the country from Mexico  ISIS is coming across the southern border  Hunter said  adding a moment later   I know that at least 10 ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the Mexican border in Texas Border Patrol agents  caught them  Hunter also said  but  you know there s going to be dozens more that did not get caught by the Border Patrol Our eyebrows were raised We sought detail No federal or state confirmation

No state or federal law enforcement agency confirmed Hunter’s account when we inquired  and Hunter spokesman Joe Kasper declined to reveal the congressman’s sources Fox News  in its original Oct  8  2014  online news report on Hunter’s declaration  quoted the Department of Homeland Security disputing his account Homeland Security told PolitiFact Texas that no such apprehensions have occurred An agency spokeswoman  Marsha Catron  emailed   The suggestion that individuals who have ties to ISIL have been apprehended at the Southwest border is categorically false  and not supported by any credible intelligence or the facts on the ground DHS continues to have no credible intelligence to suggest terrorist organizations are actively plotting to cross the southwest border And after Hunter spoke  the Texas Department of Public Safety wrote state legislators  saying in an Oct  8  2014  email it  does not have any information to confirm  statements about Islamic terrorists or ISIS fighters entering the country A DPS spokesman  Tom Vinger  confirmed the message’s authenticity In the message  a DPS deputy director  Robert Bodisch  mentioned the Hunter interview and an Oct  8  2014  news report by Judicial Watch  a conservative news website  stating Islamic terrorists had entered the country from Mexico According to unidentified Homeland Security sources  Judicial Watch said four terrorists had been apprehended in the previous 36 hours by federal authorities and the DPS in McAllen and Pharr In the message to legislators  Bodisch further wrote   An unsecure border is certainly a vulnerability that can be exploited by criminals of all kinds  and it would be naïve to rule out the possibility that any criminal organization would not look for opportunities to take advantage of security gaps along our international border That said  DPS does not have any information to confirm the specific statements recently reported in the press On Sept  17  2014  PolitiFact in Washington analyzed an August 2014 Judicial Watch story  finding Mostly False another congressman’s claim that  we know that ISIS is present in Ciudad Juarez  which neighbors El Paso Research did not turn up any law enforcement official or news outlet that independently verified or corroborated the claim  making the declaration that  we know  with certainty ISIS is in Juarez a big stretch For this fact check  a terrorism expert said Hunter’s claim doesn’t make much sense  It’s implausible given the way the criminal justice system works to have 10 ISIS fighters arrested at the border and never charged  said Daveed Gartenstein Ross  director of the Center for the Study of Terrorist Radicalization at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies in Washington Gartenstein Ross said by phone he knows of  no reporting coming through DHS suggesting that a large number of ISIS fighters have been intercepted at the border I’ve talked to a large number of people within the department  and the department has unequivocally denied it There’s not one shred of evidence this is the case Kasper  informed we d not confirmed Hunter s statement  said Hunter stands by what he said Kasper also expressed doubt federal agencies are revealing the facts about fighters getting caught  Problem here is that this is always a zero sum game  Kasper wrote  We make the point Official channels deny Then  maybe in a few years from now the information will pop up on the front page of the Washington Post   much like that newspaper this week reported new details about the Secret Service prostitution scandal  Kasper said Our ruling

Hunter said  at least 10 ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the Mexican border in Texas  and there are  dozens more that did not get caught by the Border Patrol No government agency confirms anything remotely close to the idea that at least 10 ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the Mexican border Notably  too  the lead Texas agency entrusted with public safety alerted legislators of its own lack of confirmation Similarly  the idea there are  dozens more that did not get caught by the Border Patrol  is missing a factual basis All told  this statement strikes us as incorrect and ridiculous Pants on Fire PANTS ON FIRE – The statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check ",0,688

"Jeh Johnson shoots down Duncan Hunter s assertion IS is entering U S  via Mexico Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson is pushing back against a claim made by Rep  Duncan Hunter that at least 10 Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant fighters were apprehended trying to come into the U S  from Mexico “We have no credible  specific intelligence to that effect ” Johnson said of ISIL insurgents illegally entering the country from along the southern border on CNN Wednesday evening “And I look at the intelligence reports from overseas from our southern border from our intelligence community virtually every day  numerous times a day  to be on the lookout for something of that nature So  what I’d say to the American public is we’re vigilant in looking out for individuals of suspicion who may be crossing our border ”

The top DHS official didn’t mention Hunter  a California Republican congressman  by name But on several occasions  Johnson said that public officials have a “responsibility” to not “unnecessarily frighten the American public ”

“Let’s not unduly create fear and anxiety in the American public by passing on speculation and rumor ” the secretary told host Wolf Blitzer Blitzer asked specifically about comments made Tuesday evening by Hunter  a member of the House Armed Services Committee “ A t least 10 ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the Mexican border in Texas ” the congressman said during an interview on Fox News  citing information from source from Customs and Border Protection  which is under DHS authority Hunter also suggested that it was likely that “dozens” of others linked to the terrorist group that has recently beheaded two American journalists and two British aid workers would likely not get caught by border agents and make their way into the U S

"Nicaragua Meteorite Impact Theory May Be Meteor wrong Nicaraguan officials say a meteorite gouged out a crater near the nation s capital city over the weekend  but scientists aren t so sure A committee formed by the Nicaraguan government determined that a new  39 foot wide  12 meters  crater found near the capital Managua s international airport was blasted out by a space rock strike Saturday night  Sept  6  the Associated Press reported Some Managua residents reported hearing a loud boom on Saturday  which would be consistent with a meteorite impact But other details warrant a healthy dose of skepticism  said Bill Cooke  head of the Meteoroid Environment Office at NASA s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville  Alabama  Nicaraguan Crater Possibly Caused by Meteorite  Video 
 Something that produced a crater this big should have also produced an incredibly bright fireball in the night sky  Cooke said  And no one reports a fireball  even though it was near midnight under scattered clouds Further  Managua is a big city  with lots of potential witnesses to such a night sky sight People saw a bright fireball the last time Cooke can recall a meteorite blasting out a crater on Earth  in September 2007 near the Peruvian village of Carancas — and that impact occurred in broad daylight A meteorite strike would also likely leave blackened fragments of the impacting body behind as evidence  both Cooke and meteor expert Peter Jenniskens said  If this crater has anything to do with a meteoroid impact  I would expect meteorites to be found in and around the crater  Jenniskens  of the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence  SETI  Institute in Mountain View  California  told Space com via email No such pieces have been reported  and none are visible in photos of the crater  Cooke said  So I m kind of skeptical of a meteoritic origin for this crater  he said If a space rock did indeed carve out the Nicaraguan crater  the meteorite was likely relatively small — about 3 feet  1 m  wide if made of iron  and somewhat larger if composed of rocky material  Cooke added Some Nicaraguan officials have speculated that the purported meteorite may be a piece of the asteroid 2014 RC  which flew by Earth on Sunday  Sept  7  the AP reported But that is not the case  experts said  For those wondering  the event in Nicaragua  poss meteorite is unrelated to asteroid 2014 RC Different timing  different directions  NASA officials wrote today  Sept  8  via the  AsteroidWatchTwitter account  which is run by the space agency s Near Earth Object Office at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena  California ",0,695

"ISIS Militant “Jihadi John” Identified As Young West Londoner The masked Islamic State militant known as  Jihadi John  who has been pictured in the videos of the beheadings of Western hostages  has been named The BBC understands he is Mohammed Emwazi  a Kuwaiti born British man in his mid 20s from west London  who was known to UK security services They chose not to disclose his name earlier for operational reasons Emwazi first appeared in a video last August  when he apparently killed the American journalist James Foley He was later thought to have been pictured in the videos of the beheadings of US journalist Steven Sotloff  British aid worker David Haines  British taxi driver Alan Henning  and American aid worker Abdul Rahman Kassig  also known as Peter  The Beatles 

In each of the videos  the militant appeared dressed in a black robe with a black balaclava covering all but his eyes and top of his nose Speaking with a British accent  he taunted Western powers before holding his knife to the hostages  necks  appearing to start cutting before the film stopped The victims  decapitated bodies were then shown Earlier this month  the militant featured in a video in which the Japanese journalist Kenji Goto appeared to be beheaded Hostages released by IS said he was one of three British jihadists guarding Westerners abducted by the group in Syria They were given the nicknames  John   Paul  and  Ringo  by their captives  and were known collectively as  the Beatles Analysis  Dominic Casciani  BBC News

We don t know exactly when the British or the American security services worked out that the masked man in the killing videos was Londoner Mohammed Emwazi But we do know that he was a  person of interest  to MI5 going back to at least 2010 because he features in semi secret court cases relating to extremism overseas and back in the UK Nobody in official security circles is going to comment on what they know and why they know it Emwazi has been previously described as a member of a network involving at least 13 men from London   and at least two of them were subjected to house arrest control orders or T Pims One absconded The chances of Emwazi ever returning to the UK are vanishingly small Follow Dominic at  BBCDomC

BBC News special correspondent Lucy Manning says Emwazi is understood to be about 27 years of age Friends told the Washington Post that he was raised in a middle class area of West London and studied computer programming at the University of Westminster He would on occasion pray at a mosque in Greenwich  they said Emwazi s friends told the Washington Post that they believed he started to be radicalised after travelling to Tanzania in May 2009 following his graduation He and two friends had planned to go on a safari  but once they landed in Dar es Salaam  they were detained by police and held overnight  they said Emwazi then ended up flying to Amsterdam  in the Netherlands  where he claimed to be met by British intelligence agents from MI5 who accused him of trying to travel to Somalia  where the jihadist group al Shabab operates He denied the accusation and said the agents had tried to recruit him before allowing him to return to the UK The incident is apparently described in a report published the following year by the Independent It identified Emwazi as Muhammad ibn Muazzam  Live investigation 

Emwazi later moved to Kuwait  where he got a job at a computer company But on a visit to London in June 2010  he was detained by British counter terrorism officials and prevented from flying back to Kuwait  his friends said It is believed he was known to security services in the UK and the US before leaving for Syria and was linked to a man with connections to al Shabab  says the BBC s Dominic Casciani The Washington Post said Emwazi was believed to have travelled to Syria around 2012 and later joined Islamic State  which has declared the creation of a  caliphate  in the large swathes of Syria and neighbouring Iraq it controls British police declined to comment on the reports Commander Richard Walton  head of the Metropolitan Police s Counter Terrorism Command  said in a statement   We have previously asked media outlets not to speculate about the details of our investigation on the basis that life is at risk  We are not going to confirm the identity of anyone at this stage or give an update on the progress of this live counter terrorism investigation Jihadi John sightings",0,699

OTTAWA  Ontario—A Canadian soldier standing guard at a war memorial in the country’s capital was shot to death Wednesday  and heavy gunfire then erupted inside Parliament One gunman was killed  and police said they were hunting for as many as two others The bloodshed immediately raised the specter of a coordinated terrorist attack  with Canada already on alert because of a deadly hit and run earlier in the week against two Canadian soldiers by a man who police say was fired up with radical Muslim fervor Witnesses said the soldier was gunned down at point blank range by a man carrying a rifle and dressed all in black  with a scarf over his face They said the gunman then ran off and entered Parliament  a few hundred yards away  where dozens of shots soon rang out People fled the complex by scrambling down scaffolding erected for renovations  while others took cover inside as police with rifles and body armor took up positions outside and cordoned off the normally bustling streets around Parliament Police gave no details on how the gunman died But on Twitter  Member of Parliament Craig Scott credited Parliament sergeant at arms Kevin Vickers with shooting the attacker just outside the MPs’ caucus rooms Ottawa police spokesman Chuck Benoit said two or three gunmen were believed to be involved in the attacks Gilles Michaud  assistant commissioner of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police  called it a “dynamic  unfolding situation ”

Ottawa Hospital said it received two patients  both listed in stable condition  in addition to the soldier “Today is a sad and tragic day for our city and our country ” Ottawa Mayor Jim Watson said He said it was a tragedy with “origins as yet not fully known  causes not yet fully understood ”

In Washington  President Barack Obama condemned the shootings as “outrageous ” and in a telephone call with the prime minister  offered U S  help and reassurance of the American people’s solidarity with Canada The U S  Embassy in Ottawa was locked down as a precaution  and security was tightened at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at Arlington National Cemetery just outside Washington Tony Zobl said he witnessed the soldier being gunned down from his fourth floor window directly above the National War Memorial  a 70 foot  arched granite cenotaph  or tomb  with bronze sculptures commemorating World War I “I looked out the window and saw a shooter  a man dressed all in black with a kerchief over his nose and mouth and something over his head as well  holding a rifle and shooting an honor guard in front of the cenotaph point blank  twice ” Zobl told the Canadian Press news agency “The honor guard dropped to the ground  and the shooter kind of raised his arms in triumph holding the rifle ”

"Met police denies reports of Banksy arrest If you’ve seen a story floating around on your Facebook feed about Banksy getting arrested and exposed  don’t worry because Banksy is still anonymous and well The hoax was the work of a “satirical” news site called The National Report — which I’m not linking because f ck those guys — that makes up fake stories that sound like they could be ostensibly true  usually without a trace of actual satire  as filthy  filthy clickbait It’s an awful yet unfortunately effective business model In a story which was published early this morning  The National Report claimed that Banksy was arrested in London by a 24 hour Anti Graffiti Task Force and revealed to be a 35 year old man named Paul Horner The International Business Times did some quick fact checking and exposed the story to be a hoax 

Paul Horner is the name given to a Facebook spokesperson who said the site will soon be charging users  2 99 a month – another hoax story that comes around every now and again – as well as the name from a hoax story about a 15 year old Louisiana teen who was sentenced to 25 years to life after he called a SWAT team to another teenager’s house after he beat him while playing Battlefield 4 The article is also said to have been written by Dr Darius Rubics  a fake name for a writer who claims to have be a Pulitzer prize winning reporter but who  unsurprisingly since his previous stories include ‘Obama Declares November National Muslim Appreciation Month’ and ‘Dennis Rodman Leaves US To Talk With Leaders Of Isis’  has never been awarded any prizes for excellence in journalism HAHA get it It’s funny because it’s not true I guess there’s some logic in there somewhere It’s not even entertaining to see people share stories that come from places like the The National Report since they’re designed to trick — unlike when dumb people share stories from The Onion  which are designed to actually be satire Again  and I cannot stress this enough  F ck those guys ",0,711
"No  a Planetary Alignment on Jan  4  2015  Won’t Decrease Gravity The very first nonsense I had to debunk in 2014 was a claim that on Jan  4 of that year a planetary alignment would cause gravity to decrease  allowing you to float momentarily or fall more slowly if you jumped in the air at the right moment  “Zero G Day ” This exact same hoax has resurfaced this week in a couple of places  so I’ve decided to update the debunking to include some new links and repost it  hopefully to stem the tide of silliness at year’s end It seems fitting that  hopefully  this is also the last debunking I’ll make in 2014 But who knows There’s still a week left Something you’ll never hear me say  “Well  now I’ve heard it all ”

Long experience has taught me there is always a sillier claim Always And you’re hearing that from a guy who has debunked the ideas that the Maya calendar predicted the end of the world  that the “Supermoon” caused earthquakes  and that a magnetic pole flip of the Earth will cause superstorms  and another saying the Earth is already physically starting to flip over So what’s sillier than these Well  we now have the claim that early next year—on Jan  4  2015 at 09 47 PST to be exact—due to the combined gravity of Jupiter and Pluto  you will be able to jump in the air and float for just a couple of seconds  or at least fall more slowly  depending on different “sources” It’s hard for me to overstate just how wrong this claim is First off  this exact same hoax was pulled last year  in 2014  by a site called News Hound  now offline  apparently  and a lot of people fell for it Here we are again  a year later  back at the same spot This time the joke is being made by a “news” site called Daily Buzz Live  which didn’t even bother to change much of the wording of the original hoax They even have a picture of a NASA tweet about the event 

There’s only one problem  That picture is completely fake NASA never tweeted it  and it was presumably made up wholesale for the article on Daily Buzz Live Whoever did it was clever  adding the number of retweets and favorites  but it’s as fake as a  20 iPhone you can buy on the street in New York City After all  the physics of “Zero G Day” is wrong  the claim about Pluto and Jupiter is wrong  and—and this part is the real killer—it’s based on a joke made by an astronomer nearly 40 years ago Despite this  it’s spreading around Facebook  and Twitter  so much once again that I got a lot of people asking or telling me about it That’s why I’m debunking this thing again So to get started  here’s the claim 

It has been revealed by the British astronomer Patrick Moore that  on the morning of January 4th 2014  an extraordinary astronomical event will occur At exactly 9 47 am  the planet Pluto will pass directly behind Jupiter  in relation to the Earth This rare alignment will mean that the combined gravitational force of the two planets would exert a stronger tidal pull  temporarily counteracting the Earth’s own gravity and making people weigh less Moore calls this the Jovian Plutonian Gravitational Effect Yeah  except this is all baloney To be polite OK  so why is this wrong Pluto and Jupiter  Sitting in a Tree …

First of all  the gravitational forces of the other planets in the solar system have essentially zero effect on you personally And we’re done Full stop OK  fine  I’ll give some brief details The planets are big objects with lots of gravity  but that only affects you if you’re close to them Space  however  is big—that’s why we call it space—and planets are far away This weakens their gravity on you hugely  reducing it to less than the impact of the flutter of a butterfly’s wing If you want the math  then here you go  Even if you add all of the planets together  they pull on you with a force less than 2 percent of that of the Moon The Daily Buzz Live article mentions tides  too  but that’s even worse  The combined tidal force from the planets is far less  like 0 005 percent of the Moon’s Simply put  the planets are just too far away to have any real effect on you By the way  the Moon orbits the Earth on an ellipse  so its own gravity fluctuates far more than the combined strength of the planets every two weeks Note that you cannot float in the air every two weeks And specifically  the gravity from Pluto is weakest of them all Pluto is a teeny tiny ice ball  far smaller than even our Moon … and at its closest it’s flippin’ 4 billion kilometers  2 5 billion miles  from Earth That’s a long way A car on the road half a kilometer away has more gravitational pull on you than Pluto does In fact  doing the math  I find that the Earth pulls on you about 200 trillion times harder than Pluto does That s about the same ratio as the number of cells in your body to a single cell   so this claim that you can float is like saying you can shed a single cell and fly away by flapping your arms Location3

It gets worse  amazingly The article says Pluto will be “directly behind Jupiter” on Jan  4  2015 I checked  On that day they are on nearly opposite sides of the sky They’re really far apart  about 145° You couldn’t have picked a much worse date to claim Pluto was behind Jupiter So the physics of the claim is ridiculous But the origin of the claims makes it even funnier Fool Me Once  Shame on You

The article on Daily Buzz Live mentions that this claim came from Patrick Moore He was a real astronomer in the U K  an enormously popular radio and television science program presenter—he predated Carl Sagan and is still considered an icon of science in England The wonderful thing about all this is  Moore actually did make this claim However  as Snopes com points out  it was an April Fools  Day joke Moore made this claim in 1976 on his radio program To my complete unsurprise  apparently some folks called in to say they did feel the effect This is called “priming ” where you tell people in advance that they’ll feel something due to some cause  and they will  even if the cause never happened It’s used by ghost hunters and ghost tour guides quite a bit  to spook people before they actually enter a “haunted house ” guaranteeing they’ll feel chills as they walk from room to room I’ve seen this myself first hand  People can convince themselves of amazing things that never actually happened Hope Floats

So there you go  It’s a repeat of a silly claim based on a joke in the first place I know a lot of people reading this right now are slapping their foreheads and wondering how people can be so stupid as to fall for this I understand this reaction  but I don’t share it Smart people fall for silly things all the time  and intelligence isn’t really the prime factor here Skepticism is In general  schools don’t teach people how to analyze a claim  how to tell if something makes sense on the surface of it  or how to go about looking into the claim I knew right away to do the math  and to see if Pluto and Jupiter really were aligned as the article says But all too often  people don’t think carefully  or at all  about these claims  and simply spread them through social media All it takes is literally the click of a “Share” button Pseudoscience thrives via this virulence  whereas truth must take a harder path In fact  that’s why I bother debunking stuff like this Sure  this is a silly claim  and probably harmless in practice But not all of them are  I already mentioned the “Mayan Notpocalypse” from 2012  and I can tick off a dozen other doomsday or scary claims that spread due to a lack of skepticism And of course there are real issues like global warming denial  anti vaccination  and more  which live and breathe and spread due to a lack of skepticism in the public In my original post about this in January 2014  I said  “This particular bit of fluff will dry up and float away in a day or two  but those others are here to stay for a long time ” I was wrong  and I should’ve known that something like this would resurface again in a year  it’s like the “Mars as big as the Moon” nonsense that comes back year after year Still  my hope is that every time we take a moment to inject a bit of  polite  skepticism into people’s everyday lives  it makes the world a slightly better place to be If enough of us do it often enough  we can change “slightly” to “magnificently ”",0,712

"Media Fooled Again Story Claims 7 of 28 Girls On School Trip Came Home Pregnant On December 17  a site called InSerbia info published a 400 word piece under the sensational headline 

BiH  Seven Primary School Students Pregnant After Five Day Excursion


“BiH” presumably refers to — according to the article — the ministry run by Serbia’s National Coordinator for Reproductive Health  Nenad Babici Babici is the only source the article uses for the story The original article has now been linked by the New York Post   the London Daily Mail  the New York Daily News  Australia’s Courier Mail  Newser  Cosmopolitan UK  and several others None have performed any follow up to confirm the original reporting One newspaper though  added details to the story that were never reported But we’re getting ahead of ourselves Let’s start with the underlying original story Even in Bosnia  such a culturally incendiary story should have resulted in local politicians and ne’er do wells jumping in front of a camera  and copious b roll of the school’s front entrance None of this is present The only source referenced at all in the story is Babici and his claim that it happened But notably  he is not quoted as saying it happened — he is paraphrased The remainder of the article does include a direct quote from him  but the quote doesn’t refer to the incident It instead pushes what is likely a top agenda of his ministry  which is that teenage sexual activity can have other health consequences  and that curbing teen sex is the responsibility of both the parent and the school 

National Coordinator for Reproductive Health of the Republika Srpska Nenad Babici said that children engage in sexual relations as early as at age of 13 or 14 and added that primary school students from a small town in Bosnia and Herzegovina went to a five day trip  and after some time it turned out that seven schoolgirls got pregnant on it He said that the reason for this was neglect of parents  but also educational institutions  toward the education of children Babic said that early engagement in sexual relations later leads to a series of consequences such as infertility  various diseases  miscarriages and premature births “In the Republika Srpska between 15 to 18 percent of people are struggling with infertility  we have 15 percent of miscarriages and between 5 to 10 percent premature births ” he said Only last year  according to the Clinical Center of the University in Sarajevo  31 minors gave birth  four of them are 15 years old  ten are 16 years old and 17 are 17 years old Look at that last paragraph  if a city the size of Sarajevo only recorded 31 instances of teenage births last year  then Sarajevo doesn’t have a teen pregnancy problem  unless the rate of teen pregnancies that are aborted is stratospheric Meanwhile  this story claims the girls were visiting Sarajevo from “a small town in Bosnia and Herzegovina” called Banja Luka It is not at all clear as to what population that “31 minors” is drawn from Beyond the shortcomings of the article itself  how likely is the story’s claim Statistics on the percentages of unprotected sexual encounters that result in pregnancy are not wonderful for obvious reasons  this study referenced in this BBC article puts the figure at about 5 percent  except for the short window prior to ovulation  during which the study estimates the odds at 25 percent So either the seven children were ovulating at the same time and had about four encounters each  or they each had closer to 20 encounters over the five days Or all 28 students were active and about to ovulate Either or Every scenario presented by this article seems absurdly improbable  from the incident itself to the manner of the coverage To a link seeking media searching for a scoop  this is where we are expected to either get to work debunking the article  or to stay clear So how did our brethren respond At the start of the post  I mentioned that the original article has been linked with confirmation of the original reporting by such mainstream newspapers  magazines and Websites as the New York Post  the London Daily Mail  the New York Daily News  the Australian Courier Mail  Newser  Cosmopolitan UK And — perhaps representing the worst offense of the bunch — the Daily Mail added details to the story that were never reported ",0,716

"Founding Fathers Era Time Capsule Found in Boston Some 219 years ago  founding fathers Sam Adams and Paul Revere looked on as a bit of history was tucked into a corner stone of the Massachusetts State House On Thursday  excavators carefully extracted the keepsakes  according to the Boston Globe The time capsule  contained in a 5 by 7 inch copper box  is thought to hold a collection of coins and other artifacts dating as far back as 1652 The capsule had actually already been extracted in 1855  when the original cowhide capsule was replaced with the metal box and new items  including coins from the 1800s  were added to the stash The box had then been mortared inside the State House cornerstone Meghan Kelly  a spokeswoman for the Executive Office of Administration and Finance  told the Globe the box may also hold an engraved silver plate  newspapers  the seal of the Commonwealth  cards and the title page of the Massachusetts Colony Records Time Capsule Has Steve Jobs  Computer Mouse

It’s believed to be one of the oldest time capsules ever recovered in the state — and likely would have remained in place had it not been for concerns that water had been seeping into the State House at that particular corner That inspection prompted officials to re excavate the time capsule to investigate its contents and make sure the items are in good condition “Hopefully there will be no damage and we will be able to observe the artifacts that trace us back to the history not only just of this building  but of our Commonwealth and our country ” said Secretary of State William Galvin  who was on hand for the capsule’s excavation  according to the Boston Globe As luck would have it  another time capsule was recovered in Boston just this past October That 100 year old capsule was extracted from its holding in the head of a golden lion statue that had perched atop the Old State House in downtown Boston That capsule held sealed letters  photographs  and newspaper articles Video  Mythical Roman  She Wolf  Cave Discovered

As for this most recently extracted time capsule  it’s now being held in a safe at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts On Sunday examiners will X ray the box and they plan to carefully open it and inspect its contents next week After that  it will be returned to the State House cornerstone  perhaps with a few new items added for future generations to rediscover   via Boston Globe Photo  The newly recovered time capsule Credit  WCVB screen grab",0,724

"US confirms death of Somalia terror group leader The Pentagon has confirmed that Ahmed Abdi Godane  the leader of the Islamist militant group al Shabaab  was killed in a US air strike earlier this week The United States previously said that the strike inside Somalia had targeted Godane  but did not know whether he had been killed “We have confirmed that Ahmed Godane  the co founder of al Shabaab  has been killed ” said rear admiral John Kirby  the Pentagon press secretary  describing it as a “major symbolic and operational loss” for the militant group  which aligned itself with al Qaida Al Shabaab is fighting to topple Somalia’s western backed government and regularly launches bombings and gun attacks against state targets and civilians Godane’s death could now lead to an internal power struggle On Wednesday US officials had said they were still investigating to see whether the strike on an al Shabaab encampment had killed Godane  37  who reportedly trained with the Taliban in Afghanistan At least three strikes hit a convoy of al Shabaab vehicles in southern Somalia on Monday night  according to witnesses and a spokesman for the group who spoke later with the Associated Press The al Shabaab representative said that six al Shabaab fighters had been killed in the strikes The air raid came days after African Union  AU  troops and Somali government forces launched “Operation Indian Ocean”  a major offensive aimed at seizing key ports from al Shabaab and cutting off one of their key sources of revenue  multi million dollar exports of charcoal AU forces were targeting Shabaab on several fronts  with Ugandan troops leading the offensives against the main port of Barawe  south of the capital  Mogadishu The commander of the AU in Somalia has said the death of Godane would be a “proud and happy moment for all Africa” Godane  who has a passion for poetry  seized world attention a year ago with the Westgate mall attack in Nairobi  which left at least 67 dead He warned Kenya that it would suffer further atrocities unless it withdrew its troops from the AU force in Somalia “You cannot withstand a war of attrition inside your own country ” he said in an audio message posted on a website linked to al Shabaab “So withdraw all your forces  or be prepared for an abundance of blood that will be spilt in your country ”

Washington has carried out a series of drone missile strikes in the past  including attacks reportedly targeting Godane  but rarely confirms this officially Godane took over the leadership of al Shabaab in 2008 after then chief Adan Hashi Ayro was killed by a US missile strike Also known as Mukhtar Abu Zubeyr  Godane was al Shabaab’s spiritual leader under whose direction the Somali militants forged an alliance with al Qaida In 2012 the US offered a reward of up to  7m  £4 2m  for information leading to his arrest ",0,730

Spider burrowed through tourist s stomach and up into his chest Fear not arachnophobes  the story of Bunbury s  spiderman  might not be all it seemed Perth scientists have cast doubt over claims that a spider burrowed into a man s body during his first trip to Bali The story went global on Thursday  generating hundreds of stories online Earlier this month  Dylan Thomas headed to the holiday island and sought medical help after experiencing  a really burning sensation like a searing feeling  in his abdomen Dylan Thomas says he had a spider crawl underneath his skin Thomas said a specialist dermatologist was called in and later used tweezers to remove what was believed to be a  tropical spider But it seems we may have all been caught in a web  of misinformation Arachnologist Dr Volker Framenau said whatever the creature was  it was  almost impossible  for the culprit to have been a spider  If you look at a spider  the fangs  the mouth parts they have  they are not able to burrow They can t get through skin  he said  We thought it may have been something like a mite  there are a few different parasitic mites out there  which can sometimes look a bit like a spider I can t think of any spider which could do this to a person Dr Mark Harvey from the Western Australian Museum agreed and said he found the case  bizarre  I must confess I was amazed because I ve never heard of a spider being able to survive under the skin of a human  or indeed any mammal  he said  Spiders need air to breathe  they have spiracles on the sides of their bodies where air comes into their system through a series of what we call book lungs Being under the skin of somebody  I would have thought they wouldn t have enough air to survive  Even if it was a mite  I ve never seen anything like this Even if it was an insect  I ve never heard of an insect crawling under the skin like this  so it really is a remarkable case Dr Harvey said spiders were widely feared in the community and often were the subject of urban legends  We hear about people going on holidays and having spiders lay eggs under the skin Then  the baby spiders  burst out when they return from their holiday in the tropics  he said  None of those are true  they re just made up stories  They re not actually able to dig through the skin  that s why this case is so unusual Some can burrow into soil  but they have to remove soil particles one at a time if they want to do that Something which is true  according to Dr Harvey  is that certain arachnids do  live on humans  We all have mites living on our faces They re follicle mites  but they re absolutely miniscule and you can t see them We transmit them to our children when we have kids  he said  They live in the bases of hair follicles on our faces and in some of the pores in our skin Those mites are so small  you can t see them  and they re not going to cause a blemish on the skin like this lad has on his stomach Dr Framenau said that much of the confusion could be eliminated by keeping or catching the creepy crawly offender  dead or alive  and enlisting the help of experts  It would be great if they collected it or took a photo of it  he said  If you have been bitten by something  the best thing you can do is collect it and submit it to a museum for identification before these things go viral Dylan Thomas has been contacted for comment   WA Today,1,3678
Pope Francis turns out not to have made pets in heaven comment NEW YORK — Pope Francis has given hope to gays  unmarried couples and advocates of the Big Bang theory Now  he has endeared himself to dog lovers  animal rights activists and vegans Trying to console a little boy whose dog had died  Pope Francis told him in a recent public appearance on St Peter’s Square that “paradise is open to all of God’s creatures” While it is unclear whether the Pope’s remarks helped soothe the child  they were welcomed by groups such as the Humane Society and People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals  PETA In his relatively short tenure as leader of the world’s one billion Roman Catholics since taking over from Benedict XVI  Pope Francis  77  has repeatedly caused a stir among conservatives in the church He has suggested more lenient positions than his predecessor on issues such as homosexuality  single motherhood and unwed couples Theologians cautioned that Pope Francis had spoken casually  not made a doctrinal statement Reverend James Martin  a Jesuit priest and editor at large of America  a Catholic magazine  said he believed that Pope Francis was at least asserting that “God loves and Christ redeems all of creation”  even though conservative theologians have said paradise is not for animals “He said paradise is open to all creatures ” Rev Martin said The question of whether animals go to heaven has been debated for much of the church’s history Pope Benedict said during a 2008 sermon that when an animal dies  it “just means the end of existence on earth” Ms Christine Gutleben  senior director of the Humane Society  said Pope Francis’ apparent reversal of his predecessor’s view could be enormous “If the Pope did mean that all animals go to heaven  then the implication is that animals have a soul And if that is true  then we ought to seriously consider how we treat them because they mean something to God ” she said Ms Sarah Withrow King  director of Christian outreach and engagement at PETA  one of the most activist anti slaughterhouse groups  said the Pope’s remarks could move Catholics away from consuming meat But there are differing views Mr Dave Warner  a spokesman for the National Pork Producers Council  said in an email that it “certainly does not mean that slaughtering and eating animals is a sin” THE NEW YORK TIMES,1,3679

Yesterday it was reported in The Age that an Australian man had experienced something rather strange and all kinds of horrifying during a trip to Bali After feeling a “searing sensation” around his abdomen near his old appendix scar  Dylan Thomas from Bunbury in Western Australia says he found out that a spider had crawled into his body through his scar and had made its way right up to his sternum  It wasn t really a tickling sensation  obviously once the venom started to affect my skin it was a really burning sensation like a searing feeling  he told Radio 6PR After a day or two of taking antihistamines  Thomas was feeling worse  and took himself to the hospital He says the doctors finally found the cause of his discomfort  Well after running tests and putting things inside my stomach they finally found out it was a tropical spider that s been living inside of me for the last three days  managed to get it out luckily  he told his friends on Facebook  according to Aleisha Orr at The Age It sounds pretty far fetched  and Thomas could well be telling the truth as it was relayed to him at the hospital  but Lauren Davis from io9 spoke to some scientists to get some much needed perspective  I think this is extremely suspect  unusual  and likely not possible ” arachnid expert Christopher Buddle from McGill University s Department of Natural Resource Sciences told Davis  Simply put  it is not plausible and I can think of no valid reason why a spider might  crawl beneath skin through a scar The claim that it was  feeding and moving up through the scar tissue  defies logic and defies what we know about the biology of spiders I am also sceptical because the  evidence   the spider itself  is not presented The best explanation the scientists Davis spoke to could come up with was that the doctors in Bali pulled something out of Thomas’s body  but it was far more likely to be a tick or a mite Just not a spider  I have never heard of any spider to crawl or exist under the skin or integument of any other creature  there are no parasites amongst spiders ” Marie Herberstein  who is the Head of the Department of Biological Sciences at Macquarie University in Australia  told Davis But she was careful to not completely rule out the possibility She mentions that mites are also eight legged  so perhaps it was just a really bit mite Head to io9 to read the rest of Lauren Davis s research into this odd story Other than that  all we can do now is wait for the specimen   which is reportedly sitting in a jar somewhere   to surface ",1,3685

Boko Haram ceasefire ignored as violence flares in Borno state MAIDUGURI  Nigeria — The leader of Nigeria’s Islamic extremist group Boko Haram has denied agreeing to any cease fire with the government and said more than 200 kidnapped schoolgirls all have converted to Islam and been married off In a new video released late Friday night  Abubakar Shekau dashed hopes for a prisoner exchange to get the girls released “The issue of the girls is long forgotten because I have long ago married them off ” he said  laughing “In this war  there is no going back ” he said in the video received by The Associated Press in the same way as previous messages Nigeria’s chief of defense staff  Air Chief Marshal Alex Badeh  on Oct  17 announced that Boko Haram had agreed to an immediate cease fire to end a 5 year old insurgency that has killed thousands of people and driven hundreds of thousands from their homes in northeast Nigeria But attacks and abductions have continued with the extremists this week seizing Mubi  a town of more than 200 000 people Fighting also continued Friday in Vimtin  the nearby village where Badeh was born Shekau in August announced that Boko Haram wanted to establish an Islamic caliphate  along the lines of the IS group in Syria and Iraq Fleeing residents have reported that hundreds of people are being detained for infractions of the extremists’ version of strict Shariah law in several towns and villages under their control Boko Haram’s kidnapping of 276 schoolgirls taking exams at a boarding school in the remote northeastern town of Chibok in April prompted an international campaign for their release and criticism of Nigeria’s government for not acting quickly to free them Dozens of the girls escaped on their own in the first couple of days  but 219 remain missing Unconfirmed reports have indicated that the girls have been broken up into several groups and that some may have been carried across borders into Cameroon and Chad The government had said it had negotiated with two Boko Haram leaders in Chad  with talks hosted by President Idriss Deby  and that it was confident the girls would be freed soon But Boko Haram has many factions Shekau’s announcement further discredits the government of President Goodluck Jonathan  who on Thursday formally announced his candidacy for elections on Feb  14  2015 in Africa’s most populous nation Nigeria  with some 160 million people  is divided almost equally between Muslims who dominate the north and Christians in the south The West African nation is the biggest oil producer on the continent and has its biggest economy Jonathan’s failure to curtail the insurgency and many corruption scandals are not expected to dim his chances of success The election  though  is expected to be the most hotly contested since his People’s Democratic Party took power after decades of military dictatorship ended in 1994 Dozens of ruling party legislators have defected to the coalition All Progressives Congress  losing the PDP its majority in the lower house of Parliament But the coalition is weakened by its inability to choose a presidential candidate  and primaries in December will be contested by three powerful northerners who all are Muslim Jonathan  a Christian from a minority southern tribe  has been criticized for ignoring an unwritten party rule to alternate power between Christian and Muslim leaders  adding a religious and ethnic dimension to the election ,1,3687

"Bali spider burrows under Aussie’s chest Prepare to meet   mite man Doctors removed a matchhead sized insect  believed to be a spider  from under Dylan Thomas’s skin earlier this week and have sent the creature away for testing to determine what it is It had been there for three days and burrowed up to his chest  leaving a trail of red blisters The 21 year old was on his first trip to Bali He told News Corp yesterday that doctors had pulled a tropical spider “a bit bigger than the size of a match head” from his skin There’s just one problem Spiders  according to Perth arachnid expert Dr Volker Framenau  don’t burrow in skin “They don’t have the tools  the armature  to do this sort of stuff ” Dr Framenau said “I find it highly unlikely  almost impossible  that it was a spider ’

"Boko Haram  ceasefire  doubts after attacks reported in Nigeria Nigeria has agreed a truce with militant Islamist group Boko Haram  who look set to the release schoolgirls it abducted earlier this year

The Nigerian schoolgirls kidnapped earlier this year by Islamist militant group Boko Haram look set to be released following a ceasefire agreement with the Nigerian military This truce  for which direct negotiations had been held in neighbouring Chad  marks the end of a five year conflict between the Nigerian government and the Islamist insurgents “I wish to inform this audience that a ceasefire agreement has been concluded ” chief of defence staff Alex Badeh announced at the end of a three day security meeting between Nigeria and Cameroon It appears as though the 219 school girls that are being held captive by Boko Haram will be released  although a Defence Ministry spokesman said that part of the negotiations still needs to be finalised He was “assured that the schoolgirls and all other people in their captivity are all alive and well” Nigerian presidential aide Hassan Tukur told the BBC   They ve assured us they have the girls and they will release them I am cautiously optimistic He said arrangements for their release would be finalised at a meeting next week in Chad On April 15  Boko Haram – which means ‘education is sinful  – raided a school in the remote north eastern town of Chibok  kidnapping 276 school girls and women Dozens escaped in the days after the abduction This act brought the group international notoriety  with world leaders condemning the kidnapping and internet activists launching the global social media campaign  BringBackOurGirls Boko Haram had demanded the release of detained extremists in exchange for the girls  but Nigeria president Goodluck Jonathan would not swap prisoners President Jonathan has come under fire in his country for failing to handle the threat of Boko Haram  which has reportedly killed 13 000 civilians in the years since 2009 After insurgent success  Boko Haram began seizing and holding territory in the northeast of Nigeria  declaring a caliphate similar to that of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria In recent weeks  however  the Nigerian military has taken back towns from the extremists and is thought to have killed hundreds of Boko Haram militants Mike Omeri  the Nigerian government’s spokesman on the kidnappings  said   Already  the terrorists have announced a cease fire in furtherance of their desire for peace In this regard  the government of Nigeria has  in similar vein  declared a cease fire ”

 Commitment among parts of Boko Haram and the military does appear to be genuine It is worth taking seriously  a security source told Reuters That source said  however  that it is unlikely that the ceasefire extends to all factions of the Boko Haram group  There are some talks but it depends on the buy in of the whole group I would be surprised if Shekau had suddenly changed his mind and is ready for a ceasefire  the source said The government was negotiating with Danladi Ahmadu  a man calling himself the secretary general of Boko Haram  the presidency source said It was not clear if Ahmadu is part of the same faction as Shekau Boko Haram has not made a public statement The Boko Haram crisis in Nigeria had for months been neglected by the western media following the emergence of Isis in the Middle East and more recently the Ebola outbreak in west Africa But  on Monday  major British politicians signed a letter that called for action against Boko Haram  and for the rescue of their captives Former Foreign Secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind and Lord Ashdown classed Boko Haram alongside Isis as a part of a “growing  well organised international terror network that poses a direct threat to UK national security ”

"Bali spider burrows under Aussie’s chest It was the story that had everyone paralysed with fear However  a group of spider specialists now claim the tale of the  Bunbury Spiderman  belongs in nightmares  rather than real life Scroll down for video

Dylan Thomas  21  was holidaying with friends last weekend when he woke up to find a strange red trail stretching up his stomach

Dr Volker Framenau  an Archaeologist  says   If you look at a spider  the fangs  the mouth parts they have  they are not able to burrow They can t get through skin 

Dylan Thomas was travelling in Bali earlier this month when he suffered from  a really burning sensation like a searing feeling  in his stomach He claimed he sought medical attention  at which point a dermatologist removed a  tropical spider  from his stomach with tweezers The Age have spoken with a number of local scientists who claim to have debunked the  Bunbury Spiderman  story which went viral on Thursday  and was shared thousands of time around the world Dr Volker Framenau  an Archaeologist from the Department of Terrestrial Zoology in Western Australia  said   If you look at a spider  the fangs  the mouth parts they have  they are not able to burrow They can t get through skin Dr Framenau said it was much more likely the animal was mite  as some of these can resemble a spider He said if the creature had been collected  there would be less confusion as what it actually was  and would prevent the spread of a possible virus Dr Mark Harvey  the Senior Curator of Arachnology at the West Australian Museum  said he had never heard of spiders being able to survive beneath the skin of any mammal

Dr Harvey said spiders would suffocate if they burrowed inside human skin   Spiders need air to breathe Being under the skin of somebody  I would have thought they wouldn t have enough air to survive 

Dr Mark Harvey says the fear of spiders fuels urban myths from people hoping to instil fear

Dr Mark Harvey  the Senior Curator of Arachnology at the West Australian Museum  said he had never heard of spiders being able to survive beneath the skin of any mammal  Spiders need air to breathe  they have spiracles on the sides of their bodies where air comes into their system through a series of what we call book lungs Being under the skin of somebody  I would have thought they wouldn t have enough air to survive  he told The Age Harvey said the fear most people have of spiders fuels urban myths from those hoping to instil fear It s not the first time spider fallacies has been debunked by science Last month  Charles Griswold  a spider expert at the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco  said the popular myth that  humans unwittingly swallow 8 spiders a year  was highly unlikely and unsupported by scientific evidence ",1,3696

"Teen Makes  72 Million on the Stock Market It’s been a tough month for factchecking After the Rolling Stone campus rape story unraveled  readers of all publications can be forgiven for questioning the process by which Americans get our news And now it turns out that another blockbuster story is —to quote its subject in an exclusive Observer interview—”not true ”

Monday’s edition of New York magazine includes an irresistible story about a Stuyvesant High senior named Mohammed Islam who had made a fortune investing in the stock market Reporter Jessica Pressler wrote regarding the precise number  “Though he is shy about the  72 million number  he confirmed his net worth is in the “’high eight figures ’” The New York Post followed up with a story of its own  with the fat figure playing a key role in the headline  “High school student scores  72M playing the stock market ”

And now it turns out  the real number is … zero In an exclusive interview with Mr  Islam and his friend Damir Tulemaganbetov  the baby faced boys who dress in suits with tie clips came clean Swept up in a tide of media adulation  they made the whole thing up Speaking at the offices of their newly hired crisis pr firm  5WPR and handled by a phalanx of four including the lawyer Ed Mermelstein of RheemBell Mermelsein  Mr  Islam told a story that will be familiar to just about any 12th grader—a fib turns into a lie turns into a rumor turns into a bunch of mainstream media stories and invitations to appear on CNBC Here’s how it happened Observer  What was your first contact with the New York magazine reporter Mohammed Islam  “My friend’s father worked at New York magazine and he had the reporter contact me Then she  Jessica Pressler  called me ”

You seem to be quoted saying “eight figures ” That’s not true  is it No  it is not true The Post trumpeted the boys  investment success  as did New York magazine  screencap 
The Post trumpeted the boys’ investment success  as did New York magazine  screencap 

Is there ANY figure Have you invested and made returns at all No So it’s total fiction Yes Are you interested in investing How did you get this reputation I run an investment club at Stuy High which does only simulated trades ”

If you had been playing with real money  would you have done really well The simulated trades percentage was extremely high relative to the S P Where did Jessica Pressler come up with the  72 million figure I honestly don’t know The number’s a rumor She said ‘have you made  72 million’  I led her to believe  I had made even more than  72 million on the simulated trades At this point the PR reps jumped in with Law   Order style objections A conference outside the room ensued Back into the room came Mr  Islam All I can say is for the simulated trades  I was very successful The returns were incredible and outperformed the S P Damir  tell me where you fit into this Damir Tulemaganbetov  Well  I got excited by this whole trading thing and I said hey  let me get on board I heard about this article coming out and Mohammed invited me and I met Jessica But you guys are pals outside of this We go to social gatherings and friends’ places Are you into stockpicking as well I haven’t been into it but I’m interested Mohammed  you’re from Queens and you go to this elite public high school Is this a hobby of your parents as well or would you be the first person in your family to pursue high finance Mohammed Islam  In my immediate family  just me So what did your parents think when they’re reading that you’ve got  72 million Mohammed Islam  Honestly  my dad wanted to disown me My mom basically said she’d never talk to me Their morals are that if I lie about it and don’t own up to it then they can no longer trust me … They knew it was false and they basically wanted to kill me and I haven’t spoken to them since You haven’t Where did you sleep last night Mohammed Islam  At a friend’s house But we didn’t sleep Damir Tulemaganbetov  We stayed awake all night We’ve been checking out news all over the world Are your friends blowing up your phones Damir Tulemaganbetov  He had 297 unread messages and 190 LinkedIn All the friends shared it Mohammed Islam  It was hyped up beyond belief Damir Tulemaganbetov  We were at CNBC That’s why we’re dressed up But we were there and literally in the building stressing out We had 20 minutes Then we three times asked them could we have 20 seconds to talk  The boys ended up cancelling the CNBC appearance Where do you go from here Damir Tulemaganbetov  Socially  people will be mad about it But we’re sorry Especially ot our parents Like my dad would read this and be like ‘Oh My God’ because he’s a very humble man and I portrayed him like a bad father Mohammed Islam  At school  first things first I am incredibly sorry for any misjudgment and any hurt I caused The people I’m most sorry for is my parents I did something where I can no longer gain their trust I have one sister  two years younger  and we don’t really talk So that’s that There was no  72 million  no “eight figures ” not even one figure The story is already coming unglued as the commenters on New York’s site hammer the reporter for even thinking this was possible New York has now altered its headline to back away from the  72 million figure but the story itself remains Even if this working class kid had somehow started with  100 000 as a high school freshman on day one at Stuy High  he’d have needed to average a compounded annualized return of something like 796  over the three years since C’mon  man It’s not hard to see why the story was tough to resist for New York  which placed Mr  Islam’s alleged acumen at No 12 in its 10th annual “Reasons to Love New York” issue Ms  Pressler quoted him saying  “It’s not just about money We want to create a brotherhood Like  all of us who are connected  who are in something together  who have influence  like the Koch brothers …” Yep  nothing says success—or search engine optimization—quite like “Koch brothers ”

No one asked for my opinion  but I’m going to provide it anyway  having sat with these kids for a good bit on a tough day They got carried away They’re not children But they’re not quite adults  either  and at least Mr  Islam was literally quaking as we spoke So yeah  they probably should have known better But New York and the New York Post probably should have  as well This story smelled fishy the instant it appeared and a quick dance with the calculator probably would have saved these young men—and a couple reporters—some embarrassment The Stuyvesant High School classmates stayed up all night as the crisis grew  5WPR

"Small Meteorite Strikes in Nicaragua s Capital City of Managua  Update  The story has been updated to reflect new evidence and analysis from experts News has been circulating about a potential meteorite strike near Managua  Nicaragua late Saturday night  just 13 hours or so before the close flyby of 20 m asteroid 2014 RC  leading some to suggest that the two events are related However  according to experts who have been examining the evidence  including those at NASA  the two events are completely unrelated  and the explosion in Managua may have nothing to do with objects falling from space According to the Nicaraguan news site el19digital com  an explosion occurred around 11 05 p m  Saturday night  in the city of Managua  which apparently produced a crater that was over 12 metres  39 feet  wide and about 1 5 metres  5 feet  deep  in a wooded area just to the west of the city s international airport  and just south of the Pan American Highway The video below  from RT com  shows military personnel investigating the crater  as well as the surrounding area  for potential debris from the explosion While the incident is still being investigated  officials with Nicaragua s Institute of Territorial Studies  INET  which monitors earthquake activity in the country  said that the event showed up on the agency s seismic instruments  We are convinced that this was a meteorite We have seen the crater from the impact  Wilfried Strauch from INET said in a press conference  according to Agence France Presse  AFP  You can see two waves  first  a small seismic wave when the meteorite hit earth  and then another stronger one  which is the impact of the sound However  while there have been reports of people hearing the explosion  the scientists have the seismic data from it  and they have the resulting crater  there are parts of the story that just don t add up A 20 metre wide asteroid named 2014 RC passed by Earth on Sunday  flying underneath the planet  from the perspective of someone in the northern hemisphere  and while there is roughly a 13 hour difference in the timing of these two events  some saw a potential connection between these events It s not entirely unreasonable to suggest this There are over 11 000 known near Earth asteroids flying around the Sun  and very likely millions that we haven t detected  and likely won t  because they re too small While most of these follow their own path as they circle the Sun  not all are alone Some asteroids have tiny moons orbiting them Some are best described as  rubble piles  which are groups of smaller objects only barely held together into a boulder like shape by their mutual gravity Others can be travelling along in  packs  with some members preceding or lagging behind the  pack leader    possibly due to an impact with another meteoroid or asteroid at some point So  if one of these asteroid  packs  is flying by  or an asteroid that still has debris from a past impact travelling along the same orbit  it is possible that one piece could strike the atmosphere and survive to hit the ground However  just because two events   an asteroid flyby and a meteorite impact   happen close to one another  doesn t mean that they are related We saw this back in mid February 2013  when we were watching asteroid 2012 DA14 sweep by Earth and suddenly a 20 m wide asteroid exploded over Chelyabinsk  Russia The exact timing and traced orbits of these two objects quickly showed that they were completely separate objects and the timing was a just coincidence According to NASA s Jet Propulsion Laboratory Near Earth Object Office  that appears to be the case for this event 
A meteorite without the meteor An interesting fact about this supposed  impact  is that  although the explosion was heard throughout the area  apparently nobody witnessed any bright light associated with it When a meteoroid enters the atmosphere  even if it is just a speck of dust  it is traveling so fast  typically around 17 kilometres per second or over 60 000 km h  that it heats up the air in front of it  causing the air to glow brightly and produce the streak of light in the sky we call a meteor Larger objects cause even brighter flashes  earning them the name fireball or even bolide  for an exceptionally large and bright one Some of these are so bright that they can  very briefly  turn night into day as they pass overhead Given the weather over Managua on Saturday night  scattered clouds and calm winds  it would have been very difficult to miss such a fireball or bolide lighting up their night sky  especially when it happened near a city of over 2 million people According to the Associated Press  Strauch said it was  very strange that no one reported a streak of light We have to ask if anyone has a photo or something Was it something else This lack of a fireball is a sticking point in the story While nearly all meteorites go through a  dark flight  phase during the final part of their journey to Earth s surface   after it has slowed down enough that it isn t compressing the air enough to cause it to glow   their fireball or bolide stage happens far up in the atmosphere  some 20 to 30 kilometres above the ground  making them visible far and wide across the countryside Geoff Nodkin  professional meteorite hunter and host of Science Channel s Meteorite Men  tweeted his thoughts about the possibility of this being authentic 
Notkin further commented that if it was meteorite related  he would expect there to be a very bright fireball  sonic booms during the object s dark flight and then the impact He also said that  to produce a crater like the one seen  it would have to be an iron meteorite  as they are the densest and  have formed the majority of known meteorite craters on Earth 

In an interview with National Geographic  Donald Yeomans  the author of Near Earth Objects  Finding Them Before They Find Us  said   There was no obvious optical fireball or debris trail seen prior to the explosion  so it seems unlikely that the explosion in Nicaragua was related to a meteorite impact So  what was this  if it wasn t a meteorite One very real possibility is that it was a landmine explosion  as there are still thousandsIn cas buried throughout the country  remnants of the war fought there in the 1980s While this particular event is looking more and more like a false alarm with time  it should be noted that fireballs blaze through our skies every day  as tons of material is swept up by Earth as the planet orbits the Sun Many of these are missed because they occur during the day  or over regions of the planet that aren t heavily populated Some countries have all sky camera networks to capture these events  with data being reported on sites like SpaceWeather com  U S  and the University of Western Ontario  Canada As an example  there was a bright fireball that occurred just before this explosion in Managua  but it happened thousands of kilometres away across the Atlantic Ocean  over eastern Spain  as shown in this animation taken from railway camera video  note what appears to be a second object that may be a piece breaking off the primary one ",1,3704

"Small Meteorite Hits Managua We reported on Monday that a meteor  thought possibly to be a chunk of an Earth passing asteroid  was the cause of a 40 foot crater outside the international airport in the Nicaraguan capital But astronomers and NASA scientists are now casting doubt on that possibility The biggest mystery is that no one so far has reported seeing a flash of light in the sky that would be expected to accompany such a meteor strike  While a meteoritic origin for this crater cannot be ruled out with absolute certainty  the information available at this time suggests that some other cause is responsible for its creation  NASA s blog concludes Space com reports 

It s a sentiment echoed by Wilfried Strauch  an adviser to Nicaragua s Institute of Territorial Studies  or Ineter  who concluded that it s  very strange that no one reported a streak of light  We have to ask if anyone has a photo or something  he said It also appears that a meteor landing in Nicaragua could not have come from asteroid 2014 RC  also nicknamed  Pitbull  as first thought National Geographic writes

"Hundreds of Palestinians flee as Israel opens dams into Gaza Valley The proliferation of online news outlets has democratized newsgathering  but it’s also updated the famous adage that “there’s a sucker born every minute” for the Internet age And no circus attracts the suckers quite like the Arab Israeli conflict Not only will people believe anything about Israel  their editors will let them write it And as we learned yesterday  pretty much every year someone will fall for the impossibly preposterous accusation known as the “flood libel ”

There are moments when biased coverage of Israel goes beyond mere opinion Last year  the good folks at Vox  a notoriously error ridden site  declared the existence of a bridge connecting the West Bank and Gaza It was not a maddening mistake  it was  rather  kind of endearing It was adorable  in its own way But that such a bridge does not exist is an easily verifiable fact Same goes for New York Times Jerusalem bureau chief Jodi Rudoren’s claim in 2012 that prospective Jewish construction in the West Bank would bisect the West Bank and make physical contiguity impossible As was subsequently pointed out  and corrected accordingly  this was not even close to being true and Rudoren would have known as much had she glanced at a map And this week we were treated to another version of this story  though it’s one we hear often enough It’s a bit of a hazing ritual  the Palestinians find someone they haven’t yet sold this particular lie to and watch the magic unfold The lie is this  that flooding in Gaza was caused by Israel opening dams in the South Easily the most important part of this story is the fact that there are no such dams They are the Gaza West Bank bridge of this story And yet  the story just keeps appearing because the Palestinians never run out of Western suckers One of the suckers this year was Vice News To try to hide its ignorance  Vice offered up several paragraphs of false accusations from the Palestinians followed by this attempt at “balance”  “Israeli officials categorically denied they were to blame while speaking to VICE News on Monday ”

Other outlets were more honest and ethical in the aftermath of publishing the flood libel As HonestReporting notes  the Daily Mail went with a bit of false balance but also  crucially  added a straight correction and admission of error  “An earlier version of this article stated that Israel had opened river dams in the south of the country  causing flooding in the Gaza strip In fact  there are no dams in southern Israel and the flooding was caused by rain and drainage issues We are happy to clarify this ”

According to HonestReporting  the Daily Mail piece also contained the following amazing sentence  “The flooding was today compounded after an Israeli power company cut electricity to two of Gaza’s major West Bank cities ”

And according to CAMERA  both Agence France Presse and Al Jazeera  shocking  I know  passed along the flood libel AFP pulled its video  and Al Jazeera went the Vice route by pretending the existence of magical dams is somehow in dispute The flood libel is proof that sometimes people refuse to learn from others’ mistakes See this post from Jonathan Tobin in December 2013 for a reminder that the flood libel is neither new nor surprising IDF spokeswoman Libby Weiss understandably would rather news organizations first locate their unicorns before blaming those unicorns for goring the neighbor’s ox 


So why does this keep happening Part of the frustration with reporters stems from their absolute laziness The Internet has put so much information within arm’s reach  and yet reporters are taught that when it comes to Israel  the facts are optional And that’s because the facts favor Israel If you were to draw a map of Israel  using Western news organizations’ reporting  you’d have one that showed Israel bisecting the West Bank while connecting it to Gaza via a bridge and holding parliamentary meetings in its capital of Tel Aviv None of that is true  but that’s the picture that emerges from the media’s “reporting ”

There also appears to be a kind of modified Stockholm Syndrome at work These reporters and the outlets they represent are constantly made to look like fools by Palestinian propaganda But they also seem not to mind  because they sympathize so strongly with what the propagandists and terrorists are telling them If what I’m describing to you sounds an awful lot like an activist  not a journalist  well–that’s about right And such activists play a key role in disseminating grist for the anti Semitic mill The first headline is the one that makes waves  especially in the Arab world and in Europe If the follow up is not a full retraction or correction  but rather a “balanced” piece in which Israel is permitted to deny the existence of things that plainly don’t exist  then it casts the Israeli government as a powerful entity engaged in a cover up It would be bad enough if we were forced to admit that our media just can’t get the story right But that’s naïve The truth is  much of the time our media just won’t get it right And that’s why the flood libel returns  year after year ",1,3709

"ESPN to save NFL s image with all male domestic abuse discussion UPDATE  ESPN has confirmed that no such panel will take place  for the love of all that is holy Domestic abuse  a crime that victimizes 1 3 million women a year according to the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence  is not an issue that men at the NFL seem capable of addressing  discussing  or addressing their discussion According to the NCADV   In 70 80  of intimate partner homicides  no matter which partner was killed  the man physically abused the woman before the murder It s men committing it  men not punishing them for it  men not losing their jobs over mishandling it The end result has been some of the NFL s worst public relations  ever But ESPN  a sports network that will stop at nothing to free the NFL of this shame  is about to step in and make it all better with a bold plan  Send in more men Eleven men  to be exact  who will fill out a panel prior to the Chiefs playing the Patriots tonight on Monday Night Football The panel will discuss  among other things  domestic abuse and the NFL Remember  1 3 million women are victimized by domestic abuse every year  but none of them will be on the panel Ray Lewis will be  though As will Jon Gruden  Mike Tirico  Chris Berman  Cris Carter  Mike Ditka  Adam Schefter  Tom Jackson  Keyshawn Johnson  Stuart Scott and Steve Young Esquire has a proper shaming here How have some of these guys reacted to Ray Rice and Adrian Peterson s domestic abuce scandals and Roger Goodell s gross mishandling of them  Look  the NFL did not create these problems The people in the NFL created these problems The players It’s not the commissioner It’s not the owners These kids are given the opportunity to make a lot of money and to play football Now  if they want to jeopardize that with stupid behavior and doing dumb things  then it’s their fault Why should the NFL take a black eye for what individuals do  Mike Ditka

 The only thing I m proud about is the team I played for  they did the right thing Take them off the field  Because you know what As a man  that s the only thing we really respect We don t respect no women We don t respect no kids The only thing Roger  Goodell  and them can do  take them off the field because they respect that  Cris Carter

Carter s praising of the Vikings for heroically deactivating Peterson following his admission that he hit his child with a switch is a bit off  as the team had activated him to play that week This was followed by intense public outcry and led to the Vikings then rescinding the activation a day and a half later So yeah  they did the right thing  after enough people complained about them doing the very clearly wrong thing This is a lot of men who think a lot of things about these issues but they may not possess the eloquence needed to present their points Although in somebody like Ditka s case  their points are wildly off base anyway The best type of point we can hope for tonight is  willful ignorance Why Because  as Ben Collins writes in his Esquire piece 

  ESPN has a  15 2 billion broadcasting agreement with the NFL You will not hear these words because it would interfere with the amount of money both ESPN and the NFL can make Mostly  though  the issue is this  On a panel choosing to discuss domestic abuse on the national stage  before an NFL football game  ESPN has filled out the roster with their extremely male water carrying talking heads And again  Ray freaking Lewis  who is no doubt being counted on for NFL Punishment Analysis and to discuss his long  hard journey back from being implicated in a double homicide to the unveiling of his statue in front of M T Stadium Their choice to talk about the issue is likely to be nothing more than further damage control  rather than an enlightening and frank discussion It will be very difficult to indicate that ESPN cares  and the NFL cares  and that you should care  if ESPN can t even take the issue seriously enough to find at the very least a female majority panel to discuss an issue that touches primarily women But it s okay  because Roger Goodell went to a domestic abuse call center  where he was very open about his plans to not forget about this issue as fast as he can  Call center CEO Katie  Ray Jones said Goodell did not discuss any specific policies the NFL might put in place for domestic violence Progress ",1,3711
"No  Robert Plant Didn’t Rip Up an  800 Million Contract A Led Zeppelin reunion tour  backed by an astonishing amount of money put up by British billionaire Richard Branson  will never happen — because singer Robert Plant ripped up a contract that would have paid him about  300 million to play 35 concerts with the the legendary band in just three cities The information about the aborted Led Zeppelin reunion tour came from an exclusive report in Britain’s Daily Mirror newspaper  which said that the 66 year old Plant — who during the 1970s heyday of Zeppelin was one of the world’s most successful and recognizable rock stars — simply didn’t believe it was “the right thing to do ”

“They have tried to talk him round but there is no chance ” said an anonymous source said by The Mirror to be close to Robert Plant “His mind is made up and that’s that ”

According to the Mirror story  the other two surviving members of Led Zeppelin — guitarist Jimmy Page  70  and 68 year old bass player musical arranger John Paul Jones — had already signed their mega contracts and were ready to set out on the tour  which would have taken them to London’s O2 Arena as well as Berlin and New Jersey But Plant just wasn’t into it Jason Bonham  the 48 year old son of original Led Zeppelin drummer John Bonham  has also signed on to play drums as a salaried musician on the Zep reunion tour Led Zeppelin formed in 1968 and were considered the biggest rock act in the world through the early and mid 1970s But they broke up in 1980 after John Bonham died in his sleep at age 32 following a heavy drinking binge Jason Bonham played drums with Led Zeppelin for the band’s one off reunion performance during the Ahmet Ertugun Tribute Concert in 2007 Ertugun was the record label boss who signed Led Zeppelin to Atlantic Records  sight unseen  launching the then unknown band’s meteoric career Branson  according to the Mirror  guaranteed the band more than  900 million to be split among the three original members  for the proposed Led Zeppelin reunion tour Plant’s share alone would have nearly tripled his current  already formidable net worth  which is reported at  170 million According to the Mirror’s source  Page  Jones  and Bonham were stunned by Plant’s refusal to take part in the tour “It was a no brainer for them but Robert asked for 48 hours to think about it When he said no and ripped up the paperwork he had been given  there was an enormous sense of shock ” The Mirror quotes the source as saying “There is no way they can go ahead without him ”

"Tropical spider burrowed under Bali tourist s skin Fear not arachnophobes  the story of Bunbury s  spiderman  might not be all it seemed Perth scientists have cast doubt over claims that a spider burrowed into a man s body during his first trip to Bali The story went global on Thursday  generating hundreds of stories online Earlier this month  Dylan Thomas headed to the holiday island and sought medical help after experiencing  a really burning sensation like a searing feeling  in his abdomen Dylan Thomas says he had a spider crawl underneath his skin Dylan Thomas says he had a spider crawl underneath his skin Mr Thomas said a specialist dermatologist later used tweezers to remove what was believed to be a  tropical spider Advertisement

Later that day  Thomas posted another photo that showed the scar beginning to ooze “It was a searing burn ” he said Turns out  it was a match head sized tropical spider that had burrowed into Thomas’ skin through his scar from when his appendix was removed recently “Well after running tests and putting things inside my stomach they finally found out it was a tropical spider that s been living inside of me for the last 3 days  managed to get it out luckily ” Thomas wrote in a follow up Facebook post  showing off his freshly bandaged scar “Haven t felt so violated in my life before Just glad it s all over ”
While the experience literally got under his skin  Thomas has remained in good spirits throughout the ordeal  if his Facebook posts are any indication “Still hoping I m going to develop superpowers by the time I m home ” he wrote  joking about his fitting new nickname  Spider Man “I ll be highly disappointed if I haven t    Until the next time catch you later Bali ”

The homeless man’s brother also spoke to Butler In the video   the homeless man is tracked to a convenience store that sold liquor He buys food for other homeless people with the  100 he was given by Lin Lin later confronts the man and gives him another  100 because he said he assumed he was going to buy alcohol with the money and he couldn’t believe he was so generous with his friends In another eight minute video  Lin takes Thomas out for a couple of meals  including shabu shabu on Christmas Eve  provides him with a hotel room and a surprise makeover Lin insists none of the videos were staged or scripted With hits to his YouTube channel  he joined in 2009  it’s already estimated that Lin made  52 000  not counting the Indiegogo fundraising  page he said he set up for Thomas Lin’s channel also gained him nearly 15 000 new fans Critics have already pointed out that Thomas would have had to have walked  for at least 34 minutes to the Liquor Mart  passing cheaper supermarkets along the way They also point out that a homeless and begging Thomas had a rather blase reaction for someone who had just received  100 from a stranger The eyewitness to the filming told Butler he knew Lin from his many prankster videos and said he definitely saw Thomas in Lin’s vehicle during set ups “I was there ” says Taugan Kadalim  “they didn’t ‘follow’ him They drove him there  to the liquor store Kadalim believes Thomas  56  is really homeless but that the entire video was staged “I think the manner in how they portrayed the entire video is deceitful ” Kadalim says  “And dishonest ”

He said his brother was arrested for public intoxication and put in jail Butler was unable to confirm his arrest record His brother also says Kenny is actually not broke He is due  150 000 from his parents’ estate “He’s sitting on money ” Kevin said  not sure if his brother is even aware of the Indiegogo money being collected on his behalf “But this is a scam This money needs to go to people who really need it ”

All characters appearing in the articles in this website – even those based on real people – are entirely fictional and any resemblance between them and any persons  living  dead  or undead is purely a miracle Not only does it revolve around a priest who doesn t exist  the story further claims that Archbishop O Malley  a real official of the Church  issued a public disavowal of the priest s alleged statements There is no public record of such a disavowal Among the preposterous items that have appeared on World News Daily Report over the past year or so are  news stories  claiming that a 600 pound woman gave birth to a 40 pound baby  a Japanese whaling crew was eaten alive by killer whales  and a Chinese miner found alive after being trapped underground for 17 years ",1,3723

"Video messaging service verifies timing of CNN audio recording At least two experts are questioning the authenticity of an audio file that is purported to have captured the gunshots that killed 18 year old Michael Brown in Ferguson  Missouri  earlier this month CNN law enforcement analyst Tom Fuentes and former Los Angeles police officer David Klinger both said Wednesday morning that they initially felt the recording alleged to reveal the sequence of shots fired by Officer Darren Wilson was a hoax  according to Mediaite “I’ve told your producers that for all I know this is something that one of Howard Stern’s punk people have been doing … I don’t have a high degree of confidence in it ” Klinger said on CNN’s “New Day ” “I look at this and my first inclination is that someone is trying to punk CNN ”

He cited the fact that the clip emerged two weeks after the shooting as well as the curious words being voiced by a man in the audio as reasons why he doubted its authenticity  though he said he remains open to seeing whether an investigation finds it legitimate A man’s voice can be heard in the audio telling a woman  “You are pretty You’re so fine  just going over some of your videos How could I forget ” The context of the remarks is unclear  though purported gunshots can be heard in the background And Klinger wasn’t alone in his skepticism Fuentes also said that he has qualms over the authenticity of the audio “When I heard this yesterday  I thought the exact same thing — it’s a hoax  but maybe not Maybe they’ll be able to authenticate it ” he said Fuentes said that the FBI’s investigation will likely include engineers at Quantico examining the audio to see if there was any dubbing and to examine whether the complete tape was delivered to CNN  Mediaite reported Watch their comments below 

CNN “New Day” co host Michaela Pereira noted that an attorney — a woman named Lopa Blumenthal — had delivered the audio to the network  vouching for its authenticity on behalf of her unnamed client TheBlaze first reported about the clip’s emergence in the contentious case on Tuesday ",1,3728

Yesterday  we reported on a rumor from Bleeding Cool that someone in Detroit had stolen one of the Batmobiles being used for filming in the city The rumor took off all over the web  even making its way to Detroit s local CBS affliate Our article did pretty well  probably because we found that sweet MTV contest video from 1989  showing this plot has been in motion for twenty five years But there s just one problem  it didn t happen The Detroit Free press checked with police spokesman Michael Woody  who said   The Batmobile is safe in the Batcave where it belongs He then exited the room and promptly removed a rubber mask  revealing himself to be The Joker in disguise  and laughed maniacally ",1,3732
"KFC Gets Occupational Business License To Sell Marijuana In Colorado Restaurants KFC Gets Occupational Business License To Sell Marijuana In Colorado Restaurants In 2015  there’s the quality fake news and the crappy fake news Examples Of course The quality  Fake news source The Onion quoted fake people on a very real  if unbelievable  subject on March 3  2015  As the Utah Senate weighed legal medical marijuana last week  a DEA agent testified that he came across “rabbits that had cultivated a taste for the marijuana” while eradicating illegal pot farms in the wild back country It’s hard to believe  a drug enforcement agent’s encounter with stoned rabbits  but that part’s real The fake part  The Onion quoted fake people’s reactions to the all too real news “Rabbits are going to be getting high anyway ” one hilariously fake person said “Better that it be safe  legal  and regulated ”

The crappy  Fake news site The Daily Currant wrote a story under the headline “Marijuana Overdoses Kill 37 in Colorado On First Day of Legalization” on Jan  2  2014 It began ridiculously  “Colorado is reconsidering its decision to legalize recreational pot following the deaths of dozens due to marijuana overdoses ” How anyone could believe such a story  from such an outlet  is still dumbfounding And now some more fake news is on the loose — and it falls on the crappy  lowest common denominator side The Racket Report already has hundreds of thousands of shares on its recent piece  “KFC Gets Occupational Business License To Sell Marijuana In Colorado Restaurants ”

Nevermind the story and its preposterous hypothetical for just one moment — what about the scrolling “News Ticker” above the headline pitching other “news” including “Exclusive Photos Of Miley Cyrus And Justin Bieber’s Wedding ” and “69 People Die After Drinking Bad Coors Lite At A Funeral ” Neither of those headlines threw off the 200 000 plus people sharing this story to their own social media The Racket Report’s piece said KFC “decided to incorporate a marijuana dispensary with their Colorado franchise restaurants Franchisees have the opportunity to expand into the business for an additional  35 000 setup fee The KFC Corporation was approved on February 3  2015 for their Marijuana Retail Recreational Pot   Medical Marijuana Occupational Business License Currently  42 of the nearly 100 KFC franchises in the state of Colorado have added this ‘option’ to their menu ”

Sounds believable  right Wrong As I wrote a year ago as the “Marijuana Overdoses Kill 37″ story was going viral 

We’re all too discerning to believe everything we read online But you read this and didn’t check  the site’s  About page or proven  local to Colorado news sources before Facebooking it Next time you see a major piece of news being reported by an unrecognized entity  you might think to question its content before spreading it as fact The Racket Report’s About page says “some stories on this website are fictitious ” Gee  really The beauty of the weed at KFC ridiculousness comes in the news that there is a KFC selling marijuana in California — though it’s a Kind For Cures medical dispensary and not a Kentucky Fried Chicken fast food restaurant  as Inquisitr reported The shop’s website even notes  “This ain’t no chicken joint ”",1,3733
Meteorite leaves crater in Nicaraguan capital Managua Astronomers  including experts at NASA  have questioned whether the blast and crater  reported earlier this week outside the Nicaraguan capital  were actually the product of a meteorite Initial reports  including information issued by the Nicaraguan government  suggested a piece of space rock broke off from a larger asteroid passing between the Earth and its moon   creating a sizable crater  measuring roughly 40 feet across  near Managua s international airport But NASA officials say the lack of eyewitness accounts raises doubts about that scenario Plus  astronomers say  the timeline doesn t work out  This event was separated by 13 hours from the close Earth approach of 2014 RC  so the explosion and the asteroid are unrelated  NASA asteroid expert Don Yeomans told National Geographic  There was no obvious optical fireball or debris trail seen prior to the explosion  so it seems unlikely that the explosion in Nicaragua was related to a meteorite impact Yeomans  doubts are shared by Bill Cooke  head of NASA s Meteoroid Environment Office Cooke says the energy needed to create such a crater would be the equivalent of a single ton of dynamite  For something to produce a hole in the ground that big  it would have generated a very bright fireball And nothing was reported   despite the population  Cooke told Sci Tech Today  So I m very skeptical Nicaraguan officials are apparently now quite confused themselves  and have asked the U S  to help sort the whole thing out  Considering the small amount of experience and the lack of research means  Nicaragua desires to request the good offices of the  US  embassy to get the support of the US Geological Survey  the country s deputy foreign minister  Orlando Gomez  wrote in a letter to the U S Ambassador in Managua  Phyllis Powers It s not yet clear whether the U S  will provide investigative assistance   or what the assistance would look like Whatever created the hole in the woods near Managua s airport  it packed a serious punch The government says its scientists recorded the impact at 24 seismic stations ,1,3734
"Priest who died for 48 minutes says he met God and she’s a woman Boston   So lately  tongues have been wagging due to a recent story of an elderly priest who died and had a conversation with God  and a female God at that The story has been dancing around on Facebook  Twitter  and Reddit It s also sallied across the seas and made it into the African media and the Indian media The story even made it s way to that holy land of obnoxious religious redneckery known as Texas The story goes something like this 
An old fart  er  I mean Catholic priest  in Massachusetts was officially dead for over 48 minutes before medical staff  miraculously  re started his heart  World News Daily Report says All the while  Father John Micheal O Neal says he went to heaven and met God  who was all motherly and feminine and just happened to be a woman Father O Neal  71  was rushed to the hospital in late January after being hit with a major heart attack  but was declared dead shortly after his arrival He was brought back to life via some sort of newfangled mechanical gadgetry and doctors at Massachusetts General Hospital  used more newfangled mechanical gadgetry to unclog vital arteries to his brain Soon they returned his heart to a normal rhythm Father O Neal woke up less than 48 hours later and recovered perfectly  World News Daily Report says Well  of course I mean  after all  if you re going to have a story about some elderly dude talking to God  you can t really have him die  can you That wouldn t come out in the wash There was much wringing of hands  and Catholic Blogger Bridget Mary Meehan wrote 
 The declarations of the cleric caused quite a stir in the catholic clergy of the archdiocese over the last few days  causing the Archbishop to summon a press conference to try and calm the rumors Despite the disapproval of his superiors  Father O Neal says that he will continue dedicating his life to God and spread the word of the  Holy Mother Then she wonders 
 Why is Cardinal O Malley and the Boston Archdiocese so upset You would think he d be inspired Perhaps  he is afraid that if God is a woman  then  that could put a big crack in the church s stained glass ceiling and open the door to women priests Sure  why not employ more delusional people They re certainly entertaining But why is the good Archbishop bothered Perhaps because Father John Micheal O Neal doesn t exist You see  he s really a nice old man on Shutterstock  who probably wishes he were somewhere else other than the hospital Terrence Donilon  a spokesman for Archbishop Sean P  O Malley says the story is a hoax  We do not have a priest of this name  he told Metro co uk  I believe this could be a hoax story And despite whatever Meehan thinks  it s never been verified that O Malley ever issued a public disavowal of the priest s alleged statements It s just not in the public records  About com reports Perhaps  as this story runs its course  the media will realize it was asleep when it should have been awake You see  World News Daily  makes no bones about the fact that it s a satire site Here s the site s disclaimer

Tropical spider burrowed under man s skin through appendix scar and lived there for THREE DAYS Fear not arachnophobes  the story of Bunbury s  spiderman  might not be all it seemed Perth scientists have cast doubt over claims that a spider burrowed into a man s body during his first trip to Bali The story went global on Thursday  generating hundreds of stories online Earlier this month  Dylan Thomas headed to the holiday island and sought medical help after experiencing  a really burning sensation like a searing feeling  in his abdomen Dylan Thomas says he had a spider crawl underneath his skin Thomas said a specialist dermatologist was called in and later used tweezers to remove what was believed to be a  tropical spider But it seems we may have all been caught in a web  of misinformation Arachnologist Dr Volker Framenau said whatever the creature was  it was  almost impossible  for the culprit to have been a spider  If you look at a spider  the fangs  the mouth parts they have  they are not able to burrow They can t get through skin  he said  We thought it may have been something like a mite  there are a few different parasitic mites out there  which can sometimes look a bit like a spider I can t think of any spider which could do this to a person Dr Mark Harvey from the Western Australian Museum agreed and said he found the case  bizarre  I must confess I was amazed because I ve never heard of a spider being able to survive under the skin of a human  or indeed any mammal  he said  Spiders need air to breathe  they have spiracles on the sides of their bodies where air comes into their system through a series of what we call book lungs Being under the skin of somebody  I would have thought they wouldn t have enough air to survive  Even if it was a mite  I ve never seen anything like this Even if it was an insect  I ve never heard of an insect crawling under the skin like this  so it really is a remarkable case Dr Harvey said spiders were widely feared in the community and often were the subject of urban legends  We hear about people going on holidays and having spiders lay eggs under the skin Then  the baby spiders  burst out when they return from their holiday in the tropics  he said  None of those are true  they re just made up stories  They re not actually able to dig through the skin  that s why this case is so unusual Some can burrow into soil  but they have to remove soil particles one at a time if they want to do that Something which is true  according to Dr Harvey  is that certain arachnids do  live on humans  We all have mites living on our faces They re follicle mites  but they re absolutely miniscule and you can t see them We transmit them to our children when we have kids  he said  They live in the bases of hair follicles on our faces and in some of the pores in our skin Those mites are so small  you can t see them  and they re not going to cause a blemish on the skin like this lad has on his stomach Dr Framenau said that much of the confusion could be eliminated by keeping or catching the creepy crawly offender  dead or alive  and enlisting the help of experts  It would be great if they collected it or took a photo of it  he said  If you have been bitten by something  the best thing you can do is collect it and submit it to a museum for identification before these things go viral Dylan Thomas has been contacted for comment   WA Today,1,3738
"Expert casts doubt on Bunbury man Dylan Thomas’s burrowing stomach spider story If Bali belly  dengue fever and dangerous drinks have not been enough to put you off taking a holiday to Bali   perhaps the story of  spiderman  will West Australian man Dylan Thomas may now be joking about whether he ll develop  superpowers  but on the weekend he was experiencing a  searing sensation  as a spider that had made its way into his abdomen through an old appendix scar  crawled underneath his skin  all the way up to his sternum The horrifying incident happened while the Bunbury man  now known as  spiderman  to his friends  was holidaying on the Indonesian island Dylan Thomas had a spider crawl underneath his skin Dylan Thomas had a spider crawl underneath his skin He told Radio 6PR about the experience Advertisement  
 It wasn t really a tickling sensation  obviously once the venom started to affect my skin it was a really burning sensation like a searing feeling  he said Mr Thomas said he believed the spider had burrowed into his abdomen on Friday night as he noticed a mark on his stomach on Saturday morning that continued to worsen An initial visit to a doctor on Sunday saw him diagnosed as having been bitten by an insect and sent away with antihistamines Mr Thomas spent another day with the arachnid tunneling inside of him  before going to a hospital  Well after running tests and putting things inside my stomach they finally found out it was a tropical spider that s been living inside of me for the last 3 days  managed to get it out luckily  he told his Facebook friends Two doctors who initially assessed him  had no idea  what was causing the marks on Mr Thomas s skin until they called in a specialist dermatologist The spider was eventually removed with tweezers It was dead when pulled out Mr Thomas said the experience had ruined his first trip to Bali ",1,3739

"Meteorite strike in Nicaragua puzzles experts Nicaraguan officials say a meteorite gouged out a crater near the nation s capital city over the weekend  but scientists aren t so sure A committee formed by the Nicaraguan government determined that a new  39 foot wide  12 meters  crater found near the capital Managua s international airport was blasted out by a space rock strike Saturday night  Sept  6  the Associated Press reported Some Managua residents reported hearing a loud boom on Saturday  which would be consistent with a meteorite impact But other details warrant a healthy dose of skepticism  said Bill Cooke  head of the Meteoroid Environment Office at NASA s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville  Alabama  Nicaraguan Crater Possibly Caused by Meteorite  Video 
 Something that produced a crater this big should have also produced an incredibly bright fireball in the night sky  Cooke said  And no one reports a fireball  even though it was near midnight under scattered clouds Further  Managua is a big city  with lots of potential witnesses to such a night sky sight People saw a bright fireball the last time Cooke can recall a meteorite blasting out a crater on Earth  in September 2007 near the Peruvian village of Carancas — and that impact occurred in broad daylight A meteorite strike would also likely leave blackened fragments of the impacting body behind as evidence  both Cooke and meteor expert Peter Jenniskens said  If this crater has anything to do with a meteoroid impact  I would expect meteorites to be found in and around the crater  Jenniskens  of the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence  SETI  Institute in Mountain View  California  told Space com via email No such pieces have been reported  and none are visible in photos of the crater  Cooke said  So I m kind of skeptical of a meteoritic origin for this crater  he said If a space rock did indeed carve out the Nicaraguan crater  the meteorite was likely relatively small — about 3 feet  1 m  wide if made of iron  and somewhat larger if composed of rocky material  Cooke added Some Nicaraguan officials have speculated that the purported meteorite may be a piece of the asteroid 2014 RC  which flew by Earth on Sunday  Sept  7  the AP reported But that is not the case  experts said  For those wondering  the event in Nicaragua  poss meteorite is unrelated to asteroid 2014 RC Different timing  different directions  NASA officials wrote today  Sept  8  via the  AsteroidWatchTwitter account  which is run by the space agency s Near Earth Object Office at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena  California ",1,3741

"Pope says dogs can go to heaven  ‘Paradise is open to all of God’s creatures’ 14 3K 3077reddit70  32

 RNS  When Pope Francis recently sought to comfort a distraught boy whose dog had died  the pontiff took the sort of pastoral approach he is famous for — telling the youngster not to worry  that he would one day see his pet in heaven “Paradise is open to all of God’s creatures ” Francis said reassuringly Pope Francis greets a crowd on his way to a meeting with cardinals at the Vatican on Feb  21  2014 RNS photo by David Gibson

 This image is available for Web and print publication For questions  contact Sally Morrow It was a sparkling moment on a rainy November day  and the setting in St  Peter’s Square only burnished Francis’ reputation as a kindly “people’s pope ” The story naturally lit up social media  became instant promotional material for vegetarians and animal rights groups  and on Friday even made it to the front page of The New York Times There’s only one problem  apparently none of it ever happened Yes  a version of that quotation was uttered by a pope  but it was said decades ago by Paul VI  who died in 1978 There is no evidence that Francis repeated the words during his public audience on Nov  26  as has been widely reported  nor was there was a boy mourning his dead dog So how could such a fable so quickly become taken as fact Part of the answer may be the topic of the pope’s talk to the crowd that day  which centered on the End Times and the transformation of all creation into a “new heaven” and a “new earth ” Citing St  Paul in the New Testament  Francis said that is not “the annihilation of the cosmos and of everything around us  but the bringing of all things into the fullness of being ”

The trail of digital bread crumbs then appears to lead to an Italian news report that extended Francis’ discussion of a renewed creation to the question of whether animals too will go to heaven “One day we will see our pets in the eternity of Christ ” the report quoted Paul VI as telling a disconsolate boy years ago The story was titled  somewhat misleadingly  “Paradise for animals The Pope doesn’t rule it out ” It wasn’t clear which pope the writer meant  however The next day  Nov  27  a story in the Italian daily Corriere della Sera by veteran Vaticanista Gian Guido Vecchi pushed the headline further  “The Pope and pets  “Paradise is open to all creatures ”

Vecchi faithfully recounted the pope’s talk about a new creation  and also cited Paul VI’s remark But the headline put those words in Francis’ mouth  and that became the story The Italian version of the Huffington Post picked it up next and ran an article quoting Francis as saying “We will go to heaven with the animals” and contending that the pope was quoting St  Paul – not Pope Paul – as making that statement to console a boy who lost his dog  That story  by the way  is nowhere in the Bible The urban legend became unstoppable a week later when it was translated into English and picked up by the British press  which cited St  Paul as saying that “One day we will see our animals again in  the  eternity of Christ ” while it has Francis adding the phrase  “Paradise is open to all God’s creatures ”

Fueling the meme was the fact that Francis was photographed accepting a gift of two donkeys from a company promoting the use of donkey milk for infants allergic to cow’s milk – and Francis said his own mother gave him donkey’s milk as a baby Social media and other media outlets then picked up the story  further conflating the statements and the chronology It became a hot mess of a story that was also sparking another theological debate by a pope who was known for prompting controversy The New York Times was the biggest of several outlets relating an apparently apocryphal tale about pets  paradise  and Pope Francis Show caption

The New York Times was the biggest of several outlets relating an apparently apocryphal tale about pets  paradise  and Pope Francis When The New York Times went with the story  along with input from ethicists and theologians  it became gospel truth Television programs discussed the pope’s theological breakthrough  news outlets created photo galleries of popes with cute animals  and others used it as a jumping off point to discuss what other religions think about animals and the afterlife At America magazine  the Rev James Martin wrote an essay discussing the theological implications of Francis’ statements and what level of authority they may have It was all very interesting and illuminating  but based on a misunderstanding A number of factors probably contributed to this journalistic train wreck 

The story had so much going for it  Francis took his papal name from St  Francis of Assisi  the patron saint of environmentalism who famously greeted animals as brothers and sisters Pope Francis is also preparing a major teaching document on the environment  and almost since the day he was elected in 2013 he has stressed the Christian duty to care for creation Francis also blessed a blind man’s guide dog shortly after he was elected  an affecting image that was often used in connection with these latest reports of his concern for animals Moreover  the media and the public are so primed for Francis to say novel things and disregard staid customs that the story was too good to check out  it fit with the pattern In most accounts  Francis’ comments were also set against statements by his predecessor  Benedict XVI  who insisted that animals did not have souls That apparent contrast fit a common narrative pitting the more conservative Benedict against the ostensibly liberal Francis That may be true in some areas  but probably not when it comes to animals Adding insult to injury  the Times article cited St  John Paul II as saying in 1990 that animals have souls and are “as near to God as men are ” But that  too  was a misquote  as media critic Dawn Eden explained at the website GetReligion On the other hand  there should have been warnings signs  Francis has frowned at the modern tendency to favor pets over people  and he has criticized the vast amounts of money spent by wealthy societies on animals even as children go hungry In addition  the pope’s huge popularity has led to at least one other instance of myth making  news reports last year said that Francis was sneaking out of the Vatican at night to feed the homeless around Rome The pope personally debunked that rumor in an interview last March  saying the idea “has never crossed my mind” and that “depicting the pope to be a sort of superman  a type of star  seems offensive to me ”

Maybe he’ll have to give another interview to deflate this latest story  and to offer his real thoughts on pets and paradise KRE END GIBSON",1,3743
"No  a spider  probably  didn t crawl through a man s body for several days Dylan Thomas found the spider had burrowed its way through a scar

A young Australian man picked up an unwanted souvenir in Bali last weekend when he found that a tropical spider had burrowed under his skin and travelled up his chest Dylan Thomas  21  was on holiday with friends when he woke up one morning to find a red  scar like trail on his stomach He was initially given antihistamine cream to treat what doctors in Bali thought was an insect bite But the red trail spread upwards and by Monday it had started blistering so he was sent to see a dermatologist  who discovered the small tropical spider and removed it The doctors said the spider had burrowed through a small scar left by a previous operation to remove his appendix Thomas has since returned to his home in Western Australian He told local media NT News  “It was bigger than the size of a match head ”

“It takes a lot to deter me  but I do feel violated It was a very bizarre experience just to know something like that was in my body for a couple of days” he said The staff at Bali International Medical Centre have taken the spider away for testing and will let Thomas know what kind of spider it is next week ",1,3744
"More than 200 kidnapped Nigerian girls to be released after deal reached with Boko Haram The leader of Islamist group Boko Haram has dismissed claims by the Nigerian government that it has signed a truce or agreed to release captives including the schoolgirls kidnapped in April A video handed to Nigerian media Friday showed Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau laughing away government reports that he had died or that his group had begun peace talks or signed a truce or had agreed to release the roughly 200 schoolgirls kidnapped in April In the video  Mr  Shekau bristled with theatrical rage  speaking in front of several vans with heavy machine guns strapped to them Last month  Nigeria’s government had claimed that the group  which controls much of northeastern Nigeria  had agreed to a truce while it took part in peace talks “We will not negotiate with anyone ” Mr  Shekau said Nigeria’s government spokesman had said the group had agreed to release every captive it has taken  including the 219 teenage girls kidnapped from a boarding school this year “A lie ” Mr  Shekau said The girls  he added  had all been married off and converted to Islam “They have now memorized two chapters of the Quran ”

Some military officials had also suggested Mr  Shekau had died—the third time in four years that Nigeria’s government has made this claim Mr  Shekau mentioned holding a German hostage in the 13 minute speech  in which he veered from references to Islamic State  to obscure Nigerian politicians to a threat to “eat the heart of infidels ”

Officials working for President Goodluck Jonathan and Nigeria’s defense ministry didn’t answer calls to their mobile phones The sequence of events highlighted a credibility gap between a government that is seeking re election and a militant group that has delivered on many of its threats Nigerian government officials have spent recent weeks touting their cease fire as a campaign accomplishment  Mr  Jonathan is expected to clinch a second four year term in February’s nationwide vote  but he is under pressure to show that the government’s five year war against its local Islamist insurgency is bearing fruit Boko Haram has spent the past few weeks seizing a series of small impoverished towns in northeastern Nigeria On Wednesday  the group took control of Mubi  a town of 200 000 people  sparking an exodus that included Buba Markus  a local official “I saw over 25 dead bodies scattered along the roadside ” he said ",1,3745

"Robert Plant Literally Ripped Up An  800 Million Contract To Reunite Led Zeppelin Robert Plant’s publicist has described as “rubbish” a Daily Mirror report that he rejected a £500m Led Zeppelin reunion The paper claims Jimmy Page and John Paul Jones had both signed on for the tour deal  bankrolled by Richard Branson  which would have featured John Bonham’s son Jason on drums Branson had proposed 35 concerts spanning just three cities  according to the Mirror The band would fly from London to Berlin to New Jersey in a specially outfitted jet  Branson wanted to recreate The Starship  from Led Zep’s heyday  selling tickets for the plane’s back rows at £100 000 per seat “Branson tried to pull out all of the stops ” claimed the Mirror’s source  who claimed it was enough to convince Page  Jones  and Bonham to reprise their 2007 Celebration Day show  and that the band was even considering a further 45 night tour across five more venues “But even  Branson’s  money was not enough to get Plant to sign up ” the source said “ He  asked for 48 hours to think about it ” then ripped up the contract in front of a group of promoters “His mind is made up and that’s that ”

Rumours were rife earlier this year that Zeppelin would be reforming  and Page seemed newly furious at his former bandmate “Everyone would love to play more concerts for the band ” Page said “ Robert ’s just playing games  and I’m fed up with it  to be honest with you ”

At the end of September  Page said a reunion was no longer “a possibility or on the cards” He told journalists at an event to promote the reissues of Led Zeppelin IV and Houses of the Holy  “I’m not going to give a detail by detail account of what one person says or another person says  so there’s not much more I can say about that ” The guitarist explained that he is instead planning to revisit Led Zeppelin material on a 2015 solo tour This story was amended on 10 November  following a comment from Robert Plant’s publicist",1,3750

But it’s almost certainly not true A screengrab of the likely untrue story of a priest who supposedly died and saw a female God The picture of the “priest” appears to be a stock photo  not a picture of an actual priest  Image via monitor co ug 

The story of the Catholic priest who supposedly died briefly and saw a female God has gained massive traction online  sparking debates on Reddit and getting picked up by everyone from the Dallas Ft Worth radio station KVIL FM to viral news sites such as Inquisitr Yet the story does not appear to spring from any news outlets close to Boston  Massachusetts  where the priest was reportedly working Instead  the “story” was first reported by the Daily Monitor  a newspaper based in the African nation of Uganda Why would a remote African nation be first to an American faith story Because it pulled the tale from the World News Daily Report  a “satirical” website To add insult to injury  the images of “Father O’Neal” that accompany the stories appear to be stock photos  as Reddit user NewdAccount pointed out  not pictures of an actual priest It seems this story is another bogus tale in need of debunking  like the Sandy Hook conspiracy theory or the fake report of a military coup against the Obama administration over the revelation of an alleged Colin Powell affair Spokespersons for the archdiocese of Boston were not immediately available for comment Sunday morning —

"Tropical spider burrows under man s skin  lives there for three days It was the story that had everyone paralysed with fear However  a group of spider specialists now claim the tale of the  Bunbury Spiderman  belongs in nightmares  rather than real life Scroll down for video

Dylan Thomas  21  was holidaying with friends last weekend when he woke up to find a strange red trail stretching up his stomach

Dr Volker Framenau  an Archaeologist  says   If you look at a spider  the fangs  the mouth parts they have  they are not able to burrow They can t get through skin 

Dylan Thomas was travelling in Bali earlier this month when he suffered from  a really burning sensation like a searing feeling  in his stomach He claimed he sought medical attention  at which point a dermatologist removed a  tropical spider  from his stomach with tweezers The Age have spoken with a number of local scientists who claim to have debunked the  Bunbury Spiderman  story which went viral on Thursday  and was shared thousands of time around the world Dr Volker Framenau  an Archaeologist from the Department of Terrestrial Zoology in Western Australia  said   If you look at a spider  the fangs  the mouth parts they have  they are not able to burrow They can t get through skin Dr Framenau said it was much more likely the animal was mite  as some of these can resemble a spider He said if the creature had been collected  there would be less confusion as what it actually was  and would prevent the spread of a possible virus Dr Mark Harvey  the Senior Curator of Arachnology at the West Australian Museum  said he had never heard of spiders being able to survive beneath the skin of any mammal

Dr Harvey said spiders would suffocate if they burrowed inside human skin   Spiders need air to breathe Being under the skin of somebody  I would have thought they wouldn t have enough air to survive 

Dr Mark Harvey says the fear of spiders fuels urban myths from people hoping to instil fear

Dr Mark Harvey  the Senior Curator of Arachnology at the West Australian Museum  said he had never heard of spiders being able to survive beneath the skin of any mammal  Spiders need air to breathe  they have spiracles on the sides of their bodies where air comes into their system through a series of what we call book lungs Being under the skin of somebody  I would have thought they wouldn t have enough air to survive  he told The Age Harvey said the fear most people have of spiders fuels urban myths from those hoping to instil fear It s not the first time spider fallacies has been debunked by science Last month  Charles Griswold  a spider expert at the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco  said the popular myth that  humans unwittingly swallow 8 spiders a year  was highly unlikely and unsupported by scientific evidence ",1,3758
Meteorite makes big crater in Nicaragua  government says Nasa has raised doubts about whether a loud boom and a gaping crater found in Nicaragua this weekend were caused by a meteorite  as the government has said Nasa said that while a meteorite cannot be ruled out  the lack so far of any eyewitness accounts of a fireball lighting up the nighttime sky outside the capital  Managua  suggest something else was behind the event Photos showed a crater about 39ft wide in a wooded area near Managua s international airport The head of Nasa s Meteoroid Environment Office  Bill Cooke  estimated that it would have been created by a blast of roughly the energy equivalent of 1 tonne of TNT Nasa said in a statement that a meteor capable of that would have created a ball of flame visible over a wide area About 1 5 million people live in the Nicaraguan capital Cooke said   For something to produce a hole in the ground that big  it would have generated a very bright fireball And nothing was reported … despite the population So I m very sceptical There was no word so far of any meteorite fragments being found in the crater Rosario Murillo  a government spokeswoman and wife of the president  Daniel Ortega  said on Sunday that a relatively small meteorite was responsible for the phenomenon The following afternoon she said scientists from other countries had expressed interest in coming to investigate Jaime Incer  a scientist who advises the Nicaraguan presidency on environmental matters  said he could not confirm for sure it was a meteorite  but said that  among the possibilities  it s one of the most likely He said he suspects a meteorite composed of rock Incer said it is possible nobody was looking up at the heavens when the event took place late at night Residents described it as a loud boom  I was walking back home after playing billiards  and suddenly I heard the explosion and felt the shockwave  which was very strong  said Victor Gutierrez  a 38 year old mechanic who lives less than a mile from the site of the crater  I didn t see anything in the sky either before or after Incer and Lindley Johnson  an executive for Nasa s Near Earth Object Observations Program  agreed that whatever happened in Nicaragua had nothing to do with an asteroid that flew past Earth this weekend At the time of the explosion  the object known as 2014 RC was about as far away as the moon  Johnson said 2014 RC s passage close to the planet happened about 13 hours later Cooke said there could be any number of alternative explanations  ranging from ordinance to  someone out blowing things up ,1,3759

"This Kid Made  72 Million During Lunch It’s been a tough month for factchecking After the Rolling Stone campus rape story unraveled  readers of all publications can be forgiven for questioning the process by which Americans get our news And now it turns out that another blockbuster story is —to quote its subject in an exclusive Observer interview—”not true ”

Monday’s edition of New York magazine includes an irresistible story about a Stuyvesant High senior named Mohammed Islam who had made a fortune investing in the stock market Reporter Jessica Pressler wrote regarding the precise number  “Though he is shy about the  72 million number  he confirmed his net worth is in the “’high eight figures ’” The New York Post followed up with a story of its own  with the fat figure playing a key role in the headline  “High school student scores  72M playing the stock market ”

And now it turns out  the real number is … zero In an exclusive interview with Mr  Islam and his friend Damir Tulemaganbetov  the baby faced boys who dress in suits with tie clips came clean Swept up in a tide of media adulation  they made the whole thing up Speaking at the offices of their newly hired crisis pr firm  5WPR and handled by a phalanx of four including the lawyer Ed Mermelstein of RheemBell Mermelsein  Mr  Islam told a story that will be familiar to just about any 12th grader—a fib turns into a lie turns into a rumor turns into a bunch of mainstream media stories and invitations to appear on CNBC Here’s how it happened Observer  What was your first contact with the New York magazine reporter Mohammed Islam  “My friend’s father worked at New York magazine and he had the reporter contact me Then she  Jessica Pressler  called me ”

You seem to be quoted saying “eight figures ” That’s not true  is it No  it is not true The Post trumpeted the boys  investment success  as did New York magazine  screencap 
The Post trumpeted the boys’ investment success  as did New York magazine  screencap 

Is there ANY figure Have you invested and made returns at all No So it’s total fiction Yes Are you interested in investing How did you get this reputation I run an investment club at Stuy High which does only simulated trades ”

If you had been playing with real money  would you have done really well The simulated trades percentage was extremely high relative to the S P Where did Jessica Pressler come up with the  72 million figure I honestly don’t know The number’s a rumor She said ‘have you made  72 million’  I led her to believe  I had made even more than  72 million on the simulated trades At this point the PR reps jumped in with Law   Order style objections A conference outside the room ensued Back into the room came Mr  Islam All I can say is for the simulated trades  I was very successful The returns were incredible and outperformed the S P Damir  tell me where you fit into this Damir Tulemaganbetov  Well  I got excited by this whole trading thing and I said hey  let me get on board I heard about this article coming out and Mohammed invited me and I met Jessica But you guys are pals outside of this We go to social gatherings and friends’ places Are you into stockpicking as well I haven’t been into it but I’m interested Mohammed  you’re from Queens and you go to this elite public high school Is this a hobby of your parents as well or would you be the first person in your family to pursue high finance Mohammed Islam  In my immediate family  just me So what did your parents think when they’re reading that you’ve got  72 million Mohammed Islam  Honestly  my dad wanted to disown me My mom basically said she’d never talk to me Their morals are that if I lie about it and don’t own up to it then they can no longer trust me … They knew it was false and they basically wanted to kill me and I haven’t spoken to them since You haven’t Where did you sleep last night Mohammed Islam  At a friend’s house But we didn’t sleep Damir Tulemaganbetov  We stayed awake all night We’ve been checking out news all over the world Are your friends blowing up your phones Damir Tulemaganbetov  He had 297 unread messages and 190 LinkedIn All the friends shared it Mohammed Islam  It was hyped up beyond belief Damir Tulemaganbetov  We were at CNBC That’s why we’re dressed up But we were there and literally in the building stressing out We had 20 minutes Then we three times asked them could we have 20 seconds to talk  The boys ended up cancelling the CNBC appearance Where do you go from here Damir Tulemaganbetov  Socially  people will be mad about it But we’re sorry Especially ot our parents Like my dad would read this and be like ‘Oh My God’ because he’s a very humble man and I portrayed him like a bad father Mohammed Islam  At school  first things first I am incredibly sorry for any misjudgment and any hurt I caused The people I’m most sorry for is my parents I did something where I can no longer gain their trust I have one sister  two years younger  and we don’t really talk So that’s that There was no  72 million  no “eight figures ” not even one figure The story is already coming unglued as the commenters on New York’s site hammer the reporter for even thinking this was possible New York has now altered its headline to back away from the  72 million figure but the story itself remains Even if this working class kid had somehow started with  100 000 as a high school freshman on day one at Stuy High  he’d have needed to average a compounded annualized return of something like 796  over the three years since C’mon  man It’s not hard to see why the story was tough to resist for New York  which placed Mr  Islam’s alleged acumen at No 12 in its 10th annual “Reasons to Love New York” issue Ms  Pressler quoted him saying  “It’s not just about money We want to create a brotherhood Like  all of us who are connected  who are in something together  who have influence  like the Koch brothers …” Yep  nothing says success—or search engine optimization—quite like “Koch brothers ”

No one asked for my opinion  but I’m going to provide it anyway  having sat with these kids for a good bit on a tough day They got carried away They’re not children But they’re not quite adults  either  and at least Mr  Islam was literally quaking as we spoke So yeah  they probably should have known better But New York and the New York Post probably should have  as well This story smelled fishy the instant it appeared and a quick dance with the calculator probably would have saved these young men—and a couple reporters—some embarrassment The Stuyvesant High School classmates stayed up all night as the crisis grew  5WPR

Thomas said he became homeless after his parents died within weeks of each other and the condo he shared with them was sold The video has been viewed more than 11 4 million times on YouTube since it was posted on Monday On Lin’s multiple social media pages  he says he was so moved by Thomas’ generosity that he put him up in a hotel and has launched a fundraiser to get Thomas back on his feet The account had more than  55 000 as of Wednesday morning ",1,3764
"Hundreds of Palestinians flee floods in Gaza as Israel opens dams The proliferation of online news outlets has democratized newsgathering  but it’s also updated the famous adage that “there’s a sucker born every minute” for the Internet age And no circus attracts the suckers quite like the Arab Israeli conflict Not only will people believe anything about Israel  their editors will let them write it And as we learned yesterday  pretty much every year someone will fall for the impossibly preposterous accusation known as the “flood libel ”

There are moments when biased coverage of Israel goes beyond mere opinion Last year  the good folks at Vox  a notoriously error ridden site  declared the existence of a bridge connecting the West Bank and Gaza It was not a maddening mistake  it was  rather  kind of endearing It was adorable  in its own way But that such a bridge does not exist is an easily verifiable fact Same goes for New York Times Jerusalem bureau chief Jodi Rudoren’s claim in 2012 that prospective Jewish construction in the West Bank would bisect the West Bank and make physical contiguity impossible As was subsequently pointed out  and corrected accordingly  this was not even close to being true and Rudoren would have known as much had she glanced at a map And this week we were treated to another version of this story  though it’s one we hear often enough It’s a bit of a hazing ritual  the Palestinians find someone they haven’t yet sold this particular lie to and watch the magic unfold The lie is this  that flooding in Gaza was caused by Israel opening dams in the South Easily the most important part of this story is the fact that there are no such dams They are the Gaza West Bank bridge of this story And yet  the story just keeps appearing because the Palestinians never run out of Western suckers One of the suckers this year was Vice News To try to hide its ignorance  Vice offered up several paragraphs of false accusations from the Palestinians followed by this attempt at “balance”  “Israeli officials categorically denied they were to blame while speaking to VICE News on Monday ”

Other outlets were more honest and ethical in the aftermath of publishing the flood libel As HonestReporting notes  the Daily Mail went with a bit of false balance but also  crucially  added a straight correction and admission of error  “An earlier version of this article stated that Israel had opened river dams in the south of the country  causing flooding in the Gaza strip In fact  there are no dams in southern Israel and the flooding was caused by rain and drainage issues We are happy to clarify this ”

According to HonestReporting  the Daily Mail piece also contained the following amazing sentence  “The flooding was today compounded after an Israeli power company cut electricity to two of Gaza’s major West Bank cities ”

And according to CAMERA  both Agence France Presse and Al Jazeera  shocking  I know  passed along the flood libel AFP pulled its video  and Al Jazeera went the Vice route by pretending the existence of magical dams is somehow in dispute The flood libel is proof that sometimes people refuse to learn from others’ mistakes See this post from Jonathan Tobin in December 2013 for a reminder that the flood libel is neither new nor surprising IDF spokeswoman Libby Weiss understandably would rather news organizations first locate their unicorns before blaming those unicorns for goring the neighbor’s ox 


So why does this keep happening Part of the frustration with reporters stems from their absolute laziness The Internet has put so much information within arm’s reach  and yet reporters are taught that when it comes to Israel  the facts are optional And that’s because the facts favor Israel If you were to draw a map of Israel  using Western news organizations’ reporting  you’d have one that showed Israel bisecting the West Bank while connecting it to Gaza via a bridge and holding parliamentary meetings in its capital of Tel Aviv None of that is true  but that’s the picture that emerges from the media’s “reporting ”

There also appears to be a kind of modified Stockholm Syndrome at work These reporters and the outlets they represent are constantly made to look like fools by Palestinian propaganda But they also seem not to mind  because they sympathize so strongly with what the propagandists and terrorists are telling them If what I’m describing to you sounds an awful lot like an activist  not a journalist  well–that’s about right And such activists play a key role in disseminating grist for the anti Semitic mill The first headline is the one that makes waves  especially in the Arab world and in Europe If the follow up is not a full retraction or correction  but rather a “balanced” piece in which Israel is permitted to deny the existence of things that plainly don’t exist  then it casts the Israeli government as a powerful entity engaged in a cover up It would be bad enough if we were forced to admit that our media just can’t get the story right But that’s naïve The truth is  much of the time our media just won’t get it right And that’s why the flood libel returns  year after year ",1,3765
"Rumor debunked  RoboCop style robots are not patrolling Microsoft s campus A California company is hoping to revolutionize the security business with autonomous robots The Knightscope K5 is one of four drones now patrolling Microsoft s Silicon Valley Campus Matt Stambaugh  the Calgary Eyeopener s science and technology columnist  spoke about how the five feet tall robots learn  You take them to an area  apparently an operator has to walk around the perimeter where they re supposed to patrol once  then they go about learning their environments  said Stambaugh  What they re using is a variety of different sensors essentially to take the role of what a lot of private security contractors do today According to Stambaugh  the robots are capable of detecting anomalies and making decisions  It s not quite as advanced as what Google is doing with their self driving car  but they ve got different sensors on board to make a map of the area and then they ve got code on board to decide what is something that should be reported back  They ve got thermal imaging if you need They ve got chemical sensors  licence plate recognition software  and  facial recognition software  said Stambaugh  It looks kind of like a large Roomba And so instead of looking for dust bunnies it s looking for  you know  criminals K5s to hit the market in 2015

According to Stambaugh  the robots will be hitting the market starting 2015  What the company Knightscope is trying to do is to lease these out on a per hour basis  said Stambaugh  So  6 25 an hour they ll lease you one of these K5s and that s about half the price of the average security guard There are many advantages to a robot over a human patrol  They ll work triple shift  24 hours a day The battery is supposed to last around a day and when it runs out they go back to a charging carpet and in 20 minutes they are charged up again Stambaugh also said the robots do not have any weapons  but that may change in the future  Basically what it s doing is calling back to a manned response centre if something is going wrong  he said ",1,3766
"Paradise is open to all  even dogs  Pope tells boy It was a heartwarming story for legions of pet owners and animal lovers around the world Pope Francis  talking to a distraught boy whose pet had died  declared there was a place in heaven for the creatures we share our lives with His comment was reported this week by many news media outside Italy  with dozens of articles in the United States It was veritable catnip to social media ANALYSIS   Pope Francis turns up the heat on church s future — behind closed doors
Vatican sparks controversy by saying gay couples have  gifts and qualities 
ANALYSIS   Has  rock star  Pope Francis really launched a revolution However  it turned out the pope had not made the comment Misreading of remarks

The news stories were apparently based on a misreading of remarks Pope Francis made at his weekly general audience at the Vatican on Nov  26 and on a comment that a past pope did make several decades ago Pope Paul VI  who died in 1978  once said  reportedly while comforting a child whose dog had died   one day we will see our animals in the eternity of Christ  There is a fundamental rule in journalism That is double checking  and in this case it was not done   Vatican s deputy spokesman  Father Ciro Benedettini
 There is a fundamental rule in journalism That is double checking  and in this case it was not done  the Vatican s deputy spokesman  Father Ciro Benedettini  said on Saturday  when asked about how the media ran with the story The spokesman said he received a number of calls on the story from outside Italy on Friday and was taken by surprise because he did not recall the pope saying anything like that Religion News Service was among the first media to put the record straight It said in an article published late on Friday that the error appeared to have stemmed from a piece in the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera on Nov  27  whose headline was misleading The article recounted the pope s words from his general audience on Nov  26  when the topic was the transformation of all creation into a new heaven and a new earth It cited the remark about animals and attributed it to Paul VI  but its headline said  The pope and animals  paradise is open to all creatures The New York Times  which ran a story on Thursday about the purported comment by Francis  acknowledged its mistake  saying in a correction on Friday that it had misattributed the remark by Paul VI to the current pope A spokeswoman for the New York Times did not immediately have any comment On its website  CNN also corrected its story  noting the misattribution and saying it was unclear what Francis believes about pets going to heaven A spokeswoman for CNN had no immediate comment Reuters did not publish a story on the remarks erroneously attributed to Francis What does Pope Francis think about pets As for what Francis does think about animals  he has not spoken much about them in public  but Benedettini said that from the general tone of his speeches and gestures  it is clear that he is in spiritual harmony with all of creation The spokesman said the pope was preparing an encyclical that will deal in part with the environment and recalled that a group that looks after stray dogs once brought the animals to his general audience and the pope was pleased When he made a Christmas season visit to a Rome parish last year  Francis willingly let a young girl place a lamb on his shoulders as a shepherd would carry it The pope once told priests that a good pastor should know not only the names of his parishioners but also the names of their dogs  Benedettini said Recent popes have said different things about the possible spiritual side of animals In 1990  Pope John Paul implied that animals had souls because they too were created from the breath of God In 2008  former Pope Benedict upset some animal lovers when he said only humans were  called to eternity ",1,3767

Dylan Thomas Finds Tropical Spider Burrowed Under Skin Fear not arachnophobes  the story of Bunbury s  spiderman  might not be all it seemed Perth scientists have cast doubt over claims that a spider burrowed into a man s body during his first trip to Bali The story went global on Thursday  generating hundreds of stories online Earlier this month  Dylan Thomas headed to the holiday island and sought medical help after experiencing  a really burning sensation like a searing feeling  in his abdomen Dylan Thomas says he had a spider crawl underneath his skin Thomas said a specialist dermatologist was called in and later used tweezers to remove what was believed to be a  tropical spider But it seems we may have all been caught in a web  of misinformation Arachnologist Dr Volker Framenau said whatever the creature was  it was  almost impossible  for the culprit to have been a spider  If you look at a spider  the fangs  the mouth parts they have  they are not able to burrow They can t get through skin  he said  We thought it may have been something like a mite  there are a few different parasitic mites out there  which can sometimes look a bit like a spider I can t think of any spider which could do this to a person Dr Mark Harvey from the Western Australian Museum agreed and said he found the case  bizarre  I must confess I was amazed because I ve never heard of a spider being able to survive under the skin of a human  or indeed any mammal  he said  Spiders need air to breathe  they have spiracles on the sides of their bodies where air comes into their system through a series of what we call book lungs Being under the skin of somebody  I would have thought they wouldn t have enough air to survive  Even if it was a mite  I ve never seen anything like this Even if it was an insect  I ve never heard of an insect crawling under the skin like this  so it really is a remarkable case Dr Harvey said spiders were widely feared in the community and often were the subject of urban legends  We hear about people going on holidays and having spiders lay eggs under the skin Then  the baby spiders  burst out when they return from their holiday in the tropics  he said  None of those are true  they re just made up stories  They re not actually able to dig through the skin  that s why this case is so unusual Some can burrow into soil  but they have to remove soil particles one at a time if they want to do that Something which is true  according to Dr Harvey  is that certain arachnids do  live on humans  We all have mites living on our faces They re follicle mites  but they re absolutely miniscule and you can t see them We transmit them to our children when we have kids  he said  They live in the bases of hair follicles on our faces and in some of the pores in our skin Those mites are so small  you can t see them  and they re not going to cause a blemish on the skin like this lad has on his stomach Dr Framenau said that much of the confusion could be eliminated by keeping or catching the creepy crawly offender  dead or alive  and enlisting the help of experts  It would be great if they collected it or took a photo of it  he said  If you have been bitten by something  the best thing you can do is collect it and submit it to a museum for identification before these things go viral Dylan Thomas has been contacted for comment   WA Today,1,3772
"Tropical spider burrows under man s skin  lives there for three days Prepare to meet   mite man Doctors removed a matchhead sized insect  believed to be a spider  from under Dylan Thomas’s skin earlier this week and have sent the creature away for testing to determine what it is It had been there for three days and burrowed up to his chest  leaving a trail of red blisters The 21 year old was on his first trip to Bali He told News Corp yesterday that doctors had pulled a tropical spider “a bit bigger than the size of a match head” from his skin There’s just one problem Spiders  according to Perth arachnid expert Dr Volker Framenau  don’t burrow in skin “They don’t have the tools  the armature  to do this sort of stuff ” Dr Framenau said “I find it highly unlikely  almost impossible  that it was a spider ’

More likely  Dr Framenau said  was some kind of burrowing mite “That’s a professional skin digger ” he said “There’s a lot of nasty stuff out there ”

"Tips for Chinese choosing an English name A humorous report on a satirical Web site done in the style of China s state broadcaster CCTV offers advice to Chinese on how to choose their English names  English names come with different connotations It’s not always fair to those people  but they do  the article warns  A name can come with a ‘feeling’ or idea about what sort of person you are  and where you come from The adoption of unconventional English names in China and other parts of East Asia is the source of perennial fascination and mirth among expats Any young Anglophone who teaches English in the region could rattle off a host of perplexing names he or she had to call out during class One friend of WorldViews who taught English and civics in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou had a number of students whose chosen English names were derived from screen names used during online computer games There was Orcapm  who was not to be outdone by Skycoolz  Sure  have fun and pick a random object or word as a name  but avoid them if you want a call back from that serious law firm in America  the post chides It offers this guide 

A good way to work out the ‘feeling’ of a name is to watch a bunch of American movies and sitcoms They’re full of name stereotypes — you’ll find the good girls’ are all ‘Jane’s  the jock boys’ are still ‘Buds’ and the geeks’ are called ‘Sheldon’ The report also lays out a set of rules governing the types of English names typically adopted by Chinese Be careful about what may sound inappropriate alongside common Chinese family names such as Wang or Dong In general  it s good to avoid food as a name  it suggests To put bluntly  names like Candy  Lolly  Sugar  think anything sweet  are typically thought of as ‘non smart girl’ names  or ‘stripper’ names It’s not always right  there are doubtless some very smart Candy’s out there But it’s the first thing that comes to mind Other instructions include eschewing the names of famous leaders or celebrities  Pick any name like Obama  Einstein or Madonna and you’re going to get some stares  it says  You have some pretty big shoes to fill there At a McDonald s restaurant in Hong Kong  WorldViews once was served by an employee whose badge confusingly read  Franco Mussolini One hopes he didn t harbor similar dreams of power and domination While it s easy to make fun of such unusual naming conventions  it s also hard not to appreciate the playfulness with which these names get chosen Often  Chinese people pick an English name as a play of words based on their original given Chinese name The Atlantic offers a few examples from the Cantonese speaking city of Hong Kong 

Many English names mimic the sound of Chinese given names A solicitor called Tse Kar son  for example  has Carson as his English name Singer Lee Hak kan s English name is Hacken Another singer  Chan Yik shun  is called Eason 

Ho Wai leuk  a journalist  got his name another way  When I was a student  everyone kept saying my Chinese name really fast until it started sounding like  hoh lok  he said referring to the Cantonese pronunciation for Coca Cola   so Cola stuck For most people  our names are our names and we have little choice in the matter But the practice of adopting a new English name can be seen as an exercise in self expression  especially in societies where larger trends of conformity hold some sway Who wouldn t want to be able to re brand themselves or be able to highlight some unique part of their identity Just don t use that power to call yourself  Bunny Wang  the post says Correction  An earlier version of this story reported that the original post was from CCTV It was  in fact  by a satirical news site ",1,3777

National Coordinator for Reproductive Health of the Republika Srpska Nenad Babici said that children engage in sexual relations as early as at age of 13 or 14 and added that primary school students from a small town in Bosnia and Herzegovina went to a five day trip  and after some time it turned out that seven schoolgirls got pregnant on it He said that the reason for this was neglect of parents  but also educational institutions  toward the education of children Babic said that early engagement in sexual relations later leads to a series of consequences such as infertility  various diseases  miscarriages and premature births “In the Republika Srpska between 15 to 18 percent of people are struggling with infertility  we have 15 percent of miscarriages and between 5 to 10 percent premature births ” he said Only last year  according to the Clinical Center of the University in Sarajevo  31 minors gave birth  four of them are 15 years old  ten are 16 years old and 17 are 17 years old Look at that last paragraph  if a city the size of Sarajevo only recorded 31 instances of teenage births last year  then Sarajevo doesn’t have a teen pregnancy problem  unless the rate of teen pregnancies that are aborted is stratospheric Meanwhile  this story claims the girls were visiting Sarajevo from “a small town in Bosnia and Herzegovina” called Banja Luka It is not at all clear as to what population that “31 minors” is drawn from Beyond the shortcomings of the article itself  how likely is the story’s claim Statistics on the percentages of unprotected sexual encounters that result in pregnancy are not wonderful for obvious reasons  this study referenced in this BBC article puts the figure at about 5 percent  except for the short window prior to ovulation  during which the study estimates the odds at 25 percent So either the seven children were ovulating at the same time and had about four encounters each  or they each had closer to 20 encounters over the five days Or all 28 students were active and about to ovulate Either or Every scenario presented by this article seems absurdly improbable  from the incident itself to the manner of the coverage To a link seeking media searching for a scoop  this is where we are expected to either get to work debunking the article  or to stay clear So how did our brethren respond At the start of the post  I mentioned that the original article has been linked with confirmation of the original reporting by such mainstream newspapers  magazines and Websites as the New York Post  the London Daily Mail  the New York Daily News  the Australian Courier Mail  Newser  Cosmopolitan UK And — perhaps representing the worst offense of the bunch — the Daily Mail added details to the story that were never reported ",1,3783

Female teacher facing sack after making SEX TAPE with teenager The story of English teacher Lucita Sandoval’s affair with a 16 year old student went viral after video allegedly showing the two having sex leaked But the video in question is from a porn website  and features a woman and a college student  a local newspaper found A salacious sex tape from an Argentinian teacher’s affair with her 16 year old student is likely nothing more than an Internet hoax An Argentinian newspaper debunked the racy story While the actual tape may be real  it features a woman and a college student ― not a teacher and her pupil  Nuevo Diario reported The story of teacher Lucita Sandoval went viral after video allegedly showed the 26 year old having sex with an underage student from her school in the city of Santiago del Estero The scandalous story maintained the boy filmed her without her consent and then shared the 23 minute clip with his friends on WhatsApp The story rapidly spread throughout Latin America and picked up even more steam when English wire services reported it But the woman in the video is not a teacher ― and the “boy” is a college student  the Santiago del Estero newspaper found While the tape is real  it appears to be from a porn website The real woman who appears in the clip  identified by a friend  is from a different Argentine city  Corrientes  the newspaper reported She does have a teaching degree  but was not employed at the school in question The newspaper tracked down the man in the video  too  who is well over the age of 16 and in college It’s unclear if “Lucita Sandoval” is a real teacher who was the victim of the online hoax or an entirely made up person ,1,3786
"Tropical spider burrows under man s skin  lives there for three days The frightening story about a spider that reportedly burrowed through an Australian man’s surgery scar and left a disturbing red trail up his stomach  might not be a completely accurate account  according to some arachnid experts The stomach selfie of 21 year old Dylan Thomas has gone viral around the globe after doctors at Bali International Medical Center apparently figured out his “mystery condition” was caused by a spider living under his skin for three days “Well after running tests and putting things inside my stomach they finally found out it was a tropical spider that’s been living inside of me for the last 3 days  managed to get it out luckily ” he wrote on Facebook “Haven’t felt so violated in my life before Just glad it’s all over ”

But the whole thing could have been caused by a different organism or be a complete fake  according to some “I think this is extremely suspect  unusual and likely not possible ” Christopher Buddle  associate professor at McGill University’s Department of Natural Resource Sciences  told io9 “Simply put  it is not plausible and I can think of no valid reason why a spider might ‘crawl beneath skin through a scar’ The claim that it was ‘feeding and moving up through the scar tissue’ defies logic and defies what we know about the biology of spiders I am also sceptical because the ‘evidence’  the spider itself  is not presented ”

Another scientist expressed skepticism over the situation as well  I n general this is impossible and there is no reason that a spider would do that ” Dr  Charles Griswold  Schlinger Curator of Arachnology  Emeritus  at the California Academy of Sciences  told io9 While another organism — perhaps a tick or mite — could “‘possibly’ be ‘associated’ with something like this ” Buddle said  according to io9  it at least was “certainly not a spider ”

"Meteorite makes big crater in Nicaragua  government says Experts have raised doubts about whether a loud boom and a gaping crater found in Nicaragua s crowded capital Managua this weekend were caused by a meteorite  as the government has said The impact near the international airport did not cause any known injuries  but it did leave a crater measuring 12 metres across and was felt throughout the capital The US National Aeronautics and Space Administration on Monday said that while a meteorite could not be ruled out  the lack so far of any eyewitness accounts of a fireball lighting up the nighttime sky outside Managua on Saturday suggests something else was likely behind the event Bill Cooke  head of NASA s Meteoroid Environment Office  estimated that the crater would have been created by a blast of roughly an energy equivalent of 1 ton of TNT NASA said in a statement that a meteor capable of that would have created a ball of flame visible over a wide area About 1 5 million people live in the Nicaraguan capital  For something to produce a hole in the ground that big  it would have generated a very bright fireball And nothing was reported   despite the population  Cooke said  So I m very sceptical Nicaraguan authorities believe it was a piece of the small asteroid dubbed  2014 RC  which passed very close to Earth and was estimated by astronomers to be about 20 meters big  or the size of a house  Fascinating event 

Government officials and experts visited the impact site on Sunday One of them  William Martinez  said it was not yet clear if the meteorite burned up completely or if it had been blasted into the soil  You can see mirror like spots on the sides of the crater from where the meteorite power scraped the walls  Martinez said Government spokeswoman  First Lady Rosario Murillo  said Nicaraguan authorities would be in contact with the US Geological Service to try to get more information about  this fascinating event  in the Central American nation  one of Latin America s poorest countries People who live near the crater told local media they heard a blast they took for an explosion  and that liquid  sand and dust were blown through the air  which smelled like something had burned There were no reported injuries because the impact was in a wooded spot  and flights at the airport were not affected ",1,3790
"Dead for 48 minutes  Catholic Priest claims God is female It’s a eyeball grabbing headline  “God is a woman  priest who died for 48 minutes claims ”

But it’s almost certainly not true A screengrab of the likely untrue story of a priest who supposedly died and saw a female God The picture of the “priest” appears to be a stock photo  not a picture of an actual priest  Image via monitor co ug 

The story of the Catholic priest who supposedly died briefly and saw a female God has gained massive traction online  sparking debates on Reddit and getting picked up by everyone from the Dallas Ft Worth radio station KVIL FM to viral news sites such as Inquisitr Yet the story does not appear to spring from any news outlets close to Boston  Massachusetts  where the priest was reportedly working Instead  the “story” was first reported by the Daily Monitor  a newspaper based in the African nation of Uganda Why would a remote African nation be first to an American faith story Because it pulled the tale from the World News Daily Report  a “satirical” website To add insult to injury  the images of “Father O’Neal” that accompany the stories appear to be stock photos  as Reddit user NewdAccount pointed out  not pictures of an actual priest It seems this story is another bogus tale in need of debunking  like the Sandy Hook conspiracy theory or the fake report of a military coup against the Obama administration over the revelation of an alleged Colin Powell affair Spokespersons for the archdiocese of Boston were not immediately available for comment Sunday morning —

"NBC weatherman caught urinating in the woods live on air Brian Williams took a moment during Monday’s edition of NBC Nightly News to address a very important issue As the anchor said  social media  as well as a few news websites  owes meteorologist Mike Seidel an “apology” after some “wild misinformation” circulated about what he was doing during a live appearance with Lester Holt over the weekend Williams explained that Seidel has lost communication with the NBC station and couldn’t hear Holt through his earpiece so he turned his back to the camera  took off his gloves and redialed his phone to connect for the segment “That’s when the rumors hit the web that he was perhaps writing his name in the snow ” Williams said “It was just Mike working to make it right  which is why we all love working with Mike Seidel ”

"Small Meteorite Strikes in Nicaragua s Capital City of Managua An explosion and a crater reported near the capital of Nicaragua raised suspicions on Monday that a meteorite had split off from an asteroid that passed by Earth this weekend and struck our planet But NASA scientists have now cast doubt on whether the blast outside Managua was even a meteorite at all The blast left a hole 40 feet  12 meters  wide and 19 feet  5 meters  deep outside the international airport serving Nicaragua s capital Some Nicaraguan astronomers quoted in early news reports attributed the blast to a chip off a weekend asteroid flyby But outside meteorite experts later downplayed links to the small asteroid  dubbed 2014 RC  which passed harmlessly by Earth over the weekend About the size of a house  2014 RC passed within 22 000 miles  36 000 kilometers  of our planet on Sunday  Information is limited  but the miss distance of 2014 RC actually precludes any related meteorite impact  at the Managua crater  says MIT asteroid expert Richard Binzel  by email Managua Meteorite Managua residents reported the blast just after midnight In some news reports  geophysicist Wilfried Strauch of Nicaragua s Institute of Earth Studies attributed the crater to a meteorite impact However  NASA asteroid expert Don Yeomans  author of Near Earth Objects  Finding Them Before They Find Us  says that outside experts suspect the crater wasn t caused by an impact  This event was separated by 13 hours from the close Earth approach of 2014 RC  so the explosion and the asteroid are unrelated  says Yeomans  because the Earth moves about 870 000 miles  1 4 million kilometers  in 13 hours  There was no obvious optical fireball or debris trail seen prior to the explosion  so it seems unlikely that the explosion in Nicaragua was related to a meteorite impact Russian Roulette

Meteorite impacts have occurred at the same time unconnected asteroid flybys in the past  most notably in the February 15  2013  Chelyabinsk impact  which damaged buildings across central Russia  See  Chelyabinsk Meteor  The Animated Movie That meteorite impact sprang from an object roughly the size of 2014 RC exploding in the atmosphere above Russia  with about 500 kilotons of energy  bright enough to sunburn some watchers A larger asteroid had passed harmlessly over the Southern Hemisphere on the same date Update  In a late Monday report on RC 2014  astronomers at NASA s Near Earth Object Program based at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena  California  revised size estimates for the asteroid Radar observations indicate that the asteroid is about 40 feet  12 meters  across and rotates rapidly  several times a minute That makes it roughly half the size of the 2013 Russian meteorite The NASA update also called the meteorite report from Managua  unrelated  to RC 2014  citing the 13 hour difference in the asteroid flyby and the crater explosion  As yet  no eyewitness accounts or imagery have come to light of the fireball flash or debris trail that is typically associated with a meteor of the size required to produce such a crater  noted the statement ",1,3793

"Catholic Priest Dead For 48 Minutes  Is Miraculously Revived – His Revelations About God Are Even More Shocking Boston   So lately  tongues have been wagging due to a recent story of an elderly priest who died and had a conversation with God  and a female God at that The story has been dancing around on Facebook  Twitter  and Reddit It s also sallied across the seas and made it into the African media and the Indian media The story even made it s way to that holy land of obnoxious religious redneckery known as Texas The story goes something like this 
An old fart  er  I mean Catholic priest  in Massachusetts was officially dead for over 48 minutes before medical staff  miraculously  re started his heart  World News Daily Report says All the while  Father John Micheal O Neal says he went to heaven and met God  who was all motherly and feminine and just happened to be a woman Father O Neal  71  was rushed to the hospital in late January after being hit with a major heart attack  but was declared dead shortly after his arrival He was brought back to life via some sort of newfangled mechanical gadgetry and doctors at Massachusetts General Hospital  used more newfangled mechanical gadgetry to unclog vital arteries to his brain Soon they returned his heart to a normal rhythm Father O Neal woke up less than 48 hours later and recovered perfectly  World News Daily Report says Well  of course I mean  after all  if you re going to have a story about some elderly dude talking to God  you can t really have him die  can you That wouldn t come out in the wash There was much wringing of hands  and Catholic Blogger Bridget Mary Meehan wrote 
 The declarations of the cleric caused quite a stir in the catholic clergy of the archdiocese over the last few days  causing the Archbishop to summon a press conference to try and calm the rumors Despite the disapproval of his superiors  Father O Neal says that he will continue dedicating his life to God and spread the word of the  Holy Mother Then she wonders 
 Why is Cardinal O Malley and the Boston Archdiocese so upset You would think he d be inspired Perhaps  he is afraid that if God is a woman  then  that could put a big crack in the church s stained glass ceiling and open the door to women priests Sure  why not employ more delusional people They re certainly entertaining But why is the good Archbishop bothered Perhaps because Father John Micheal O Neal doesn t exist You see  he s really a nice old man on Shutterstock  who probably wishes he were somewhere else other than the hospital Terrence Donilon  a spokesman for Archbishop Sean P  O Malley says the story is a hoax  We do not have a priest of this name  he told Metro co uk  I believe this could be a hoax story And despite whatever Meehan thinks  it s never been verified that O Malley ever issued a public disavowal of the priest s alleged statements It s just not in the public records  About com reports Perhaps  as this story runs its course  the media will realize it was asleep when it should have been awake You see  World News Daily  makes no bones about the fact that it s a satire site Here s the site s disclaimer

An additional 14 police officers have been arrested and confessed to participating in the disappearance  Murillo Karam said  bringing the total number of detainees to 50 The 14 are from the police force of Cocula  a town neighboring Iguala  where the confrontation took place in the southern state of Guerrero Both the mayor and police chief of Iguala are fugitives and accused of links to the local drug cartel  Guerrero Unidos  believed to have worked with police in disappearing the students The gang controls drug routes in Guerrero and Morelos states Murillo Karam said that officials had yet to identify the masterminds or a motive in the attack  but that the collusion might have gone beyond just one town  There s a connection We will determine if it was coordination or subordination  but it s clear to me that they were working together  he said of police and drug traffickers in the area Police opened fire on about 100 students who had hijacked buses to return to campus after arriving in Iguala to pass the hat for their school Teachers college students are known throughout Mexico for using radical tactics to raise money and spread their leftist philosophy Six people were killed  25 wounded and dozens of students rounded up by police There has been no sign of the missing in nearly three weeks  leading investigators to comb the clandestine burial sites outside of Iguala  where drug cartels are believed to dump their enemies On Tuesday  Guerrero Gov Angel Aguirre said many of the bodies at the first site appeared to have been buried for some time  suggesting they belonged to earlier victims of criminal gangs  Some of them are not recent  some are from months ago  Aguirre told MVS radio One forensic expert  who works with federal investigators  said identification is an arduous process that takes time Charred remains like those recovered at the first mass graves can leave very little DNA for testing  If a bone is burned at more than 300 degrees  it s almost impossible to identify because the collagen is burned Because of that  criminal organizations started to adopt that technique  said Jorge Arturo Talavera  head of the bio archaeology team at the Mexico s National Institute of Anthropology and History He said the way the remains are exhumed also can affect identification If they re pulled out in a hurried manner  other identifying articles like jewelry or teeth get discarded Hundreds of teachers  students and relatives of the missing marched to the center of the state capital  Chilpancingo  on Tuesday  taking a much more solemn tone after a night of angry protests and vandalism that badly damaged the state capital building They lined up in silence as organizers passed out white flowers Some carried candles with a sprawling billboard offering a 1 million peso  75 000  reward for information On Monday  protesters demanding to know the whereabouts of the missing smashed windows at the state capital building complex in Chilpancingo  132 miles  212 kilometers  south of Mexico City  and set fire to some of the buildings Students from the school and local teachers blockaded the capital complex  pelting it with sticks  rocks and Molotov cocktails The finance secretary of Guerrero state said six buildings were affected Also Tuesday  an alleged leader of the Guerreros Unidos killed himself during a confrontation with Mexican security forces Tuesday Federal forces were carrying out an operation to capture Benjamin Mondragon  or  Benjamon  when a gunbattle broke out  National Security Commissioner Monte Alejandro Rubido said Mondragon killed himself as he was about to be arrested  Rubido said  though he had no details on how The official said it was unclear whether Mondragon was involved in the students  disappearances President Enrique Pena Nieto said the disappearances  are without doubt a topic that will lead the Mexican government at all levels to take actions that will prevent events like those in Iguala from ever occurring again He said the government  will strengthen institutions  especially those involved in law enforcement  so that they act with greater reliability and efficiency

"Meteor Leaves 40 Foot Crater Near Managua s Airport Nicaraguan officials say a meteorite gouged out a crater near the nation s capital city over the weekend  but scientists aren t so sure A committee formed by the Nicaraguan government determined that a new  39 foot wide  12 meters  crater found near the capital Managua s international airport was blasted out by a space rock strike Saturday night  Sept  6  the Associated Press reported Some Managua residents reported hearing a loud boom on Saturday  which would be consistent with a meteorite impact But other details warrant a healthy dose of skepticism  said Bill Cooke  head of the Meteoroid Environment Office at NASA s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville  Alabama  Nicaraguan Crater Possibly Caused by Meteorite  Video 
 Something that produced a crater this big should have also produced an incredibly bright fireball in the night sky  Cooke said  And no one reports a fireball  even though it was near midnight under scattered clouds Further  Managua is a big city  with lots of potential witnesses to such a night sky sight People saw a bright fireball the last time Cooke can recall a meteorite blasting out a crater on Earth  in September 2007 near the Peruvian village of Carancas — and that impact occurred in broad daylight A meteorite strike would also likely leave blackened fragments of the impacting body behind as evidence  both Cooke and meteor expert Peter Jenniskens said  If this crater has anything to do with a meteoroid impact  I would expect meteorites to be found in and around the crater  Jenniskens  of the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence  SETI  Institute in Mountain View  California  told Space com via email No such pieces have been reported  and none are visible in photos of the crater  Cooke said  So I m kind of skeptical of a meteoritic origin for this crater  he said If a space rock did indeed carve out the Nicaraguan crater  the meteorite was likely relatively small — about 3 feet  1 m  wide if made of iron  and somewhat larger if composed of rocky material  Cooke added Some Nicaraguan officials have speculated that the purported meteorite may be a piece of the asteroid 2014 RC  which flew by Earth on Sunday  Sept  7  the AP reported But that is not the case  experts said  For those wondering  the event in Nicaragua  poss meteorite is unrelated to asteroid 2014 RC Different timing  different directions  NASA officials wrote today  Sept  8  via the  AsteroidWatchTwitter account  which is run by the space agency s Near Earth Object Office at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena  California ",1,3803
"Man discovers spider living under his skin during Bali vacation It was the story that had everyone paralysed with fear However  a group of spider specialists now claim the tale of the  Bunbury Spiderman  belongs in nightmares  rather than real life Scroll down for video

Dylan Thomas  21  was holidaying with friends last weekend when he woke up to find a strange red trail stretching up his stomach

Dr Volker Framenau  an Archaeologist  says   If you look at a spider  the fangs  the mouth parts they have  they are not able to burrow They can t get through skin 

Dylan Thomas was travelling in Bali earlier this month when he suffered from  a really burning sensation like a searing feeling  in his stomach He claimed he sought medical attention  at which point a dermatologist removed a  tropical spider  from his stomach with tweezers The Age have spoken with a number of local scientists who claim to have debunked the  Bunbury Spiderman  story which went viral on Thursday  and was shared thousands of time around the world Dr Volker Framenau  an Archaeologist from the Department of Terrestrial Zoology in Western Australia  said   If you look at a spider  the fangs  the mouth parts they have  they are not able to burrow They can t get through skin Dr Framenau said it was much more likely the animal was mite  as some of these can resemble a spider He said if the creature had been collected  there would be less confusion as what it actually was  and would prevent the spread of a possible virus Dr Mark Harvey  the Senior Curator of Arachnology at the West Australian Museum  said he had never heard of spiders being able to survive beneath the skin of any mammal

Dr Harvey said spiders would suffocate if they burrowed inside human skin   Spiders need air to breathe Being under the skin of somebody  I would have thought they wouldn t have enough air to survive 

Dr Mark Harvey says the fear of spiders fuels urban myths from people hoping to instil fear

Dr Mark Harvey  the Senior Curator of Arachnology at the West Australian Museum  said he had never heard of spiders being able to survive beneath the skin of any mammal  Spiders need air to breathe  they have spiracles on the sides of their bodies where air comes into their system through a series of what we call book lungs Being under the skin of somebody  I would have thought they wouldn t have enough air to survive  he told The Age Harvey said the fear most people have of spiders fuels urban myths from those hoping to instil fear It s not the first time spider fallacies has been debunked by science Last month  Charles Griswold  a spider expert at the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco  said the popular myth that  humans unwittingly swallow 8 spiders a year  was highly unlikely and unsupported by scientific evidence ",1,3804

Spider burrowed into appendix scar  crawled through WA man s body Fear not arachnophobes  the story of Bunbury s  spiderman  might not be all it seemed Perth scientists have cast doubt over claims that a spider burrowed into a man s body during his first trip to Bali The story went global on Thursday  generating hundreds of stories online Earlier this month  Dylan Thomas headed to the holiday island and sought medical help after experiencing  a really burning sensation like a searing feeling  in his abdomen Dylan Thomas says he had a spider crawl underneath his skin Thomas said a specialist dermatologist was called in and later used tweezers to remove what was believed to be a  tropical spider But it seems we may have all been caught in a web  of misinformation Arachnologist Dr Volker Framenau said whatever the creature was  it was  almost impossible  for the culprit to have been a spider  If you look at a spider  the fangs  the mouth parts they have  they are not able to burrow They can t get through skin  he said  We thought it may have been something like a mite  there are a few different parasitic mites out there  which can sometimes look a bit like a spider I can t think of any spider which could do this to a person Dr Mark Harvey from the Western Australian Museum agreed and said he found the case  bizarre  I must confess I was amazed because I ve never heard of a spider being able to survive under the skin of a human  or indeed any mammal  he said  Spiders need air to breathe  they have spiracles on the sides of their bodies where air comes into their system through a series of what we call book lungs Being under the skin of somebody  I would have thought they wouldn t have enough air to survive  Even if it was a mite  I ve never seen anything like this Even if it was an insect  I ve never heard of an insect crawling under the skin like this  so it really is a remarkable case Dr Harvey said spiders were widely feared in the community and often were the subject of urban legends  We hear about people going on holidays and having spiders lay eggs under the skin Then  the baby spiders  burst out when they return from their holiday in the tropics  he said  None of those are true  they re just made up stories  They re not actually able to dig through the skin  that s why this case is so unusual Some can burrow into soil  but they have to remove soil particles one at a time if they want to do that Something which is true  according to Dr Harvey  is that certain arachnids do  live on humans  We all have mites living on our faces They re follicle mites  but they re absolutely miniscule and you can t see them We transmit them to our children when we have kids  he said  They live in the bases of hair follicles on our faces and in some of the pores in our skin Those mites are so small  you can t see them  and they re not going to cause a blemish on the skin like this lad has on his stomach Dr Framenau said that much of the confusion could be eliminated by keeping or catching the creepy crawly offender  dead or alive  and enlisting the help of experts  It would be great if they collected it or took a photo of it  he said  If you have been bitten by something  the best thing you can do is collect it and submit it to a museum for identification before these things go viral Dylan Thomas has been contacted for comment   WA Today,1,3807

"Israel opens dams  floods Gaza The proliferation of online news outlets has democratized newsgathering  but it’s also updated the famous adage that “there’s a sucker born every minute” for the Internet age And no circus attracts the suckers quite like the Arab Israeli conflict Not only will people believe anything about Israel  their editors will let them write it And as we learned yesterday  pretty much every year someone will fall for the impossibly preposterous accusation known as the “flood libel ”

There are moments when biased coverage of Israel goes beyond mere opinion Last year  the good folks at Vox  a notoriously error ridden site  declared the existence of a bridge connecting the West Bank and Gaza It was not a maddening mistake  it was  rather  kind of endearing It was adorable  in its own way But that such a bridge does not exist is an easily verifiable fact Same goes for New York Times Jerusalem bureau chief Jodi Rudoren’s claim in 2012 that prospective Jewish construction in the West Bank would bisect the West Bank and make physical contiguity impossible As was subsequently pointed out  and corrected accordingly  this was not even close to being true and Rudoren would have known as much had she glanced at a map And this week we were treated to another version of this story  though it’s one we hear often enough It’s a bit of a hazing ritual  the Palestinians find someone they haven’t yet sold this particular lie to and watch the magic unfold The lie is this  that flooding in Gaza was caused by Israel opening dams in the South Easily the most important part of this story is the fact that there are no such dams They are the Gaza West Bank bridge of this story And yet  the story just keeps appearing because the Palestinians never run out of Western suckers One of the suckers this year was Vice News To try to hide its ignorance  Vice offered up several paragraphs of false accusations from the Palestinians followed by this attempt at “balance”  “Israeli officials categorically denied they were to blame while speaking to VICE News on Monday ”

Other outlets were more honest and ethical in the aftermath of publishing the flood libel As HonestReporting notes  the Daily Mail went with a bit of false balance but also  crucially  added a straight correction and admission of error  “An earlier version of this article stated that Israel had opened river dams in the south of the country  causing flooding in the Gaza strip In fact  there are no dams in southern Israel and the flooding was caused by rain and drainage issues We are happy to clarify this ”

According to HonestReporting  the Daily Mail piece also contained the following amazing sentence  “The flooding was today compounded after an Israeli power company cut electricity to two of Gaza’s major West Bank cities ”

And according to CAMERA  both Agence France Presse and Al Jazeera  shocking  I know  passed along the flood libel AFP pulled its video  and Al Jazeera went the Vice route by pretending the existence of magical dams is somehow in dispute The flood libel is proof that sometimes people refuse to learn from others’ mistakes See this post from Jonathan Tobin in December 2013 for a reminder that the flood libel is neither new nor surprising IDF spokeswoman Libby Weiss understandably would rather news organizations first locate their unicorns before blaming those unicorns for goring the neighbor’s ox 


So why does this keep happening Part of the frustration with reporters stems from their absolute laziness The Internet has put so much information within arm’s reach  and yet reporters are taught that when it comes to Israel  the facts are optional And that’s because the facts favor Israel If you were to draw a map of Israel  using Western news organizations’ reporting  you’d have one that showed Israel bisecting the West Bank while connecting it to Gaza via a bridge and holding parliamentary meetings in its capital of Tel Aviv None of that is true  but that’s the picture that emerges from the media’s “reporting ”

There also appears to be a kind of modified Stockholm Syndrome at work These reporters and the outlets they represent are constantly made to look like fools by Palestinian propaganda But they also seem not to mind  because they sympathize so strongly with what the propagandists and terrorists are telling them If what I’m describing to you sounds an awful lot like an activist  not a journalist  well–that’s about right And such activists play a key role in disseminating grist for the anti Semitic mill The first headline is the one that makes waves  especially in the Arab world and in Europe If the follow up is not a full retraction or correction  but rather a “balanced” piece in which Israel is permitted to deny the existence of things that plainly don’t exist  then it casts the Israeli government as a powerful entity engaged in a cover up It would be bad enough if we were forced to admit that our media just can’t get the story right But that’s naïve The truth is  much of the time our media just won’t get it right And that’s why the flood libel returns  year after year ",1,3810

The story of the Catholic priest who supposedly died briefly and saw a female God has gained massive traction online  sparking debates on Reddit and getting picked up by everyone from the Dallas Ft Worth radio station KVIL FM to viral news sites such as Inquisitr Yet the story does not appear to spring from any news outlets close to Boston  Massachusetts  where the priest was reportedly working Instead  the “story” was first reported by the Daily Monitor  a newspaper based in the African nation of Uganda Why would a remote African nation be first to an American faith story Because it pulled the tale from the World News Daily Report  a “satirical” website To add insult to injury  the images of “Father O’Neal” that accompany the stories appear to be stock photos  as Reddit user NewdAccount pointed out  not pictures of an actual priest It seems this story is another bogus tale in need of debunking  like the Sandy Hook conspiracy theory or the fake report of a military coup against the Obama administration over the revelation of an alleged Colin Powell affair Spokespersons for the archdiocese of Boston were not immediately available for comment Sunday morning —

Hoax Alert  Father O’Neal  Who Has Met God and Thinks She’s a Woman  Is Made Up  Just Like God Herself 
February 22  2015 by Terry Firma 84 Comments
Not that I’m impossible to fool  but this is certainly a bit rich  all typos and grammatical errors in the original 
A Catholic priest from Massachussetts was officially dead for more than 48 minutes before medics were able to miraculously re start his heart During that time  Father John Micheal O’neal claims he went to heaven and met God  which he describes as a warm and comforting motherly figure That story  in various iterations  has been popping up in my news feed all day Even apart from the matter of God’s gender  on which I offer no thoughts  and the matter of religious near death experiences  which I addressed here  there’s no truth to the article It is a hoax  a falsehood that was  probably  designed to attract cheap clicks There is no 71 year old Father John Michael O’Neal in Massachusetts whose heart failure required hospitalization  and who met God during a 48 minute detour through heaven If you go to Shutterstock and search for “old man in hospital bed ” this photo is among the top results 

You can find the same image on stock photo sites like Dreamstime and Photolia As best I can tell  the story originated with World News Daily Report in early February The publication claims to be an “American Jewish Zionist newspaper in Tel Aviv ” and unleashes on the world such fine fare as “California Man Gets 25 Pound Penile Implant to Become Pornstar ” “World Famous Taj Mahal to Be Turned into 5 Star Hotel ” and “Hollywood’s Most Famous ‘Butt Double’ Found Dead in Motel Room ” Perhaps it’s supposed to be satire Since then  the tale of “Father O’Neal” was initially picked up mostly by African news media with low news standards  such as Nigeria Tell  Spy Ghana  and Uganda’s Sunday Monitor  whose motto is “Truth Everyday” From there  it migrated and multiplied to lots of other  perhaps accidental  bullshit peddlers  from India Today to KVIL  a CBS Radio affiliate in Texas This weekend  it’s been all over Facebook  Twitter  and Reddit I would’ve thought that religious life contains enough real absurdities to quash the need to make up additional ones  
P S   Feast your eyes on one of the most fatuous nonpologies ever After she was informed that her post about Father O’Neal is based on a lie  Catholic blogger Bridget Mary Meehan wrote 
According to a recent media update  this story is false  but I believe if it hasn’t yet happened  it truly will Someone once said  “all stories are true some actually happened ”
Because  you know  fuck the facts ",1,3821

"Animal lovers abuzz over pope’s comments that  paradise is open to all of God’s creatures  14 3K 3077reddit70  32

 RNS  When Pope Francis recently sought to comfort a distraught boy whose dog had died  the pontiff took the sort of pastoral approach he is famous for — telling the youngster not to worry  that he would one day see his pet in heaven “Paradise is open to all of God’s creatures ” Francis said reassuringly Pope Francis greets a crowd on his way to a meeting with cardinals at the Vatican on Feb  21  2014 RNS photo by David Gibson

 This image is available for Web and print publication For questions  contact Sally Morrow It was a sparkling moment on a rainy November day  and the setting in St  Peter’s Square only burnished Francis’ reputation as a kindly “people’s pope ” The story naturally lit up social media  became instant promotional material for vegetarians and animal rights groups  and on Friday even made it to the front page of The New York Times There’s only one problem  apparently none of it ever happened Yes  a version of that quotation was uttered by a pope  but it was said decades ago by Paul VI  who died in 1978 There is no evidence that Francis repeated the words during his public audience on Nov  26  as has been widely reported  nor was there was a boy mourning his dead dog So how could such a fable so quickly become taken as fact Part of the answer may be the topic of the pope’s talk to the crowd that day  which centered on the End Times and the transformation of all creation into a “new heaven” and a “new earth ” Citing St  Paul in the New Testament  Francis said that is not “the annihilation of the cosmos and of everything around us  but the bringing of all things into the fullness of being ”

The trail of digital bread crumbs then appears to lead to an Italian news report that extended Francis’ discussion of a renewed creation to the question of whether animals too will go to heaven “One day we will see our pets in the eternity of Christ ” the report quoted Paul VI as telling a disconsolate boy years ago The story was titled  somewhat misleadingly  “Paradise for animals The Pope doesn’t rule it out ” It wasn’t clear which pope the writer meant  however The next day  Nov  27  a story in the Italian daily Corriere della Sera by veteran Vaticanista Gian Guido Vecchi pushed the headline further  “The Pope and pets  “Paradise is open to all creatures ”

Vecchi faithfully recounted the pope’s talk about a new creation  and also cited Paul VI’s remark But the headline put those words in Francis’ mouth  and that became the story The Italian version of the Huffington Post picked it up next and ran an article quoting Francis as saying “We will go to heaven with the animals” and contending that the pope was quoting St  Paul – not Pope Paul – as making that statement to console a boy who lost his dog  That story  by the way  is nowhere in the Bible The urban legend became unstoppable a week later when it was translated into English and picked up by the British press  which cited St  Paul as saying that “One day we will see our animals again in  the  eternity of Christ ” while it has Francis adding the phrase  “Paradise is open to all God’s creatures ”

Fueling the meme was the fact that Francis was photographed accepting a gift of two donkeys from a company promoting the use of donkey milk for infants allergic to cow’s milk – and Francis said his own mother gave him donkey’s milk as a baby Social media and other media outlets then picked up the story  further conflating the statements and the chronology It became a hot mess of a story that was also sparking another theological debate by a pope who was known for prompting controversy The New York Times was the biggest of several outlets relating an apparently apocryphal tale about pets  paradise  and Pope Francis Show caption

The New York Times was the biggest of several outlets relating an apparently apocryphal tale about pets  paradise  and Pope Francis When The New York Times went with the story  along with input from ethicists and theologians  it became gospel truth Television programs discussed the pope’s theological breakthrough  news outlets created photo galleries of popes with cute animals  and others used it as a jumping off point to discuss what other religions think about animals and the afterlife At America magazine  the Rev James Martin wrote an essay discussing the theological implications of Francis’ statements and what level of authority they may have It was all very interesting and illuminating  but based on a misunderstanding A number of factors probably contributed to this journalistic train wreck 

The story had so much going for it  Francis took his papal name from St  Francis of Assisi  the patron saint of environmentalism who famously greeted animals as brothers and sisters Pope Francis is also preparing a major teaching document on the environment  and almost since the day he was elected in 2013 he has stressed the Christian duty to care for creation Francis also blessed a blind man’s guide dog shortly after he was elected  an affecting image that was often used in connection with these latest reports of his concern for animals Moreover  the media and the public are so primed for Francis to say novel things and disregard staid customs that the story was too good to check out  it fit with the pattern In most accounts  Francis’ comments were also set against statements by his predecessor  Benedict XVI  who insisted that animals did not have souls That apparent contrast fit a common narrative pitting the more conservative Benedict against the ostensibly liberal Francis That may be true in some areas  but probably not when it comes to animals Adding insult to injury  the Times article cited St  John Paul II as saying in 1990 that animals have souls and are “as near to God as men are ” But that  too  was a misquote  as media critic Dawn Eden explained at the website GetReligion On the other hand  there should have been warnings signs  Francis has frowned at the modern tendency to favor pets over people  and he has criticized the vast amounts of money spent by wealthy societies on animals even as children go hungry In addition  the pope’s huge popularity has led to at least one other instance of myth making  news reports last year said that Francis was sneaking out of the Vatican at night to feed the homeless around Rome The pope personally debunked that rumor in an interview last March  saying the idea “has never crossed my mind” and that “depicting the pope to be a sort of superman  a type of star  seems offensive to me ”

Maybe he’ll have to give another interview to deflate this latest story  and to offer his real thoughts on pets and paradise KRE END GIBSON",1,3827

"Teen Makes  72 Million on the Stock Market Mohammed Islam  the 17 year old whose profile has circulated across the nation  says he did not make  72 million from trading stocks Islam  a high school student at Stuyvesant in New York City  was profiled by the New Yorker  which claimed that he made  72 million from the market But Islam told CNBC that the figure is not accurate  although he declined to be more specific other than saying it’s closer to a few million dollars “The attention is not what we expected – we never wanted the hype This was about friends trying to make something exciting together  ” Islam said “We expected a regular article about what we hope to do” in our career  he said “The way we were portrayed is not who we are ”

The New Yorker claimed that it got the figure from rumors “Our story portrays the  72 million figure as a rumor  the initial headline has been changed to more clearly reflect the fact that we did not know the exact figure he has made in trades ” it said in a statement “However  Mohammed provided bank statements that showed he is worth eight figures  and he confirmed on the record that he’s worth eight figures ”

Islam says he would like to become a hedge fund manager  and find a mentor who is a great trader His inspiration is Paul Tudor Jones Islam  who trades mainly in Crude Oil futures and Gold futures and small to mid cap equities  told Business Insider he’s already learned a lot “When I learned that I needed discipline  a strategy that had been back tested  and enough capital  I buckled down and made sure I didn’t make one more trade until I had done that ” he said “I traded using my plan and didn’t go astray and followed the cardinal rule of minimizing losses and maximizing profits This made me profitable and to this day I look upon that as a major goal I accomplished ”",1,3829

Francis has consistently made headlines with sometimes controversial remarks since assuming the papacy in 2013 Vatican observers have called him a  radical  because of his open mindedness and desire to reach out to  the grassroots of Catholic life The 77 year old leader of the world s one billion Roman Catholics has adopted more liberal positions than his predecessor  stirring up tensions with conservative Catholics on issues such as homosexuality and single motherhood In one such instance in July 2013  Francis struck a compassionate tone when speaking about homosexuality  If a person is gay and seeks God and has good will  who am I to judge he said to reporters on a flight returning to the Vatican from Brazil Francis s papal name comes from St  Francis of Assisi  the church s patron saint of animals and the ecology ",1,3838

Seeking truth in stir of 11 missing   stolen commercial airliners from the Libyan airport during the fall of Tripoli Origins  In early August 2014  some North African bloggers began to spread stories that several commercial airliners were missing from the Tripoli International Airport during or shortly after the facility was taken over by Zintan militia forces earlier in the summer Later that month translations of the blog posts began to be picked up by news outlets in Western Europe and passed on as fact rather than gossip  by early September those tales of translations of blogs had spread to the United States under the guise of real news The use of airplanes as terrorist weapons in 2001 makes it all too easy for us to anticipate their being used that way again And despite denials from all sides — the airlines who are not missing any planes  the Libyan transport ministry  and the anti government forces in control of the airport — the tales have found a ready audience among a populace already on edge in anticipation of the anniversary of the 9 11 attacks However  there have been no statements from the State Department  the Department of Defense  Homeland Security  or any other authority warning of stolen airliners The national threat level has not been raised Algerian and Moroccan military and air defense  already on high alert due to the unrest just across their borders with Libya  would undoubtedly have noticed multiple flights of unidentified passenger aircraft   google ad client    pub 6608306193529351  google ad width   468  google ad height   60  google ad format    468x60 as  google ad type    text  google ad channel    0054321535  google color border    000000   ",1,3839

This Is a Truly Horrifying Story About a Spider There s a story currently making the rounds about an Australian man who  upon returning from a trip to Bali  discovered that a spider burrowed under his skin and traveled up to his chest Freaky Yes  but it s also not plausible Rest easy  arachnophobes You do not have to worry about Charlotte weaving her web beneath your flesh The supposed story goes like this  Dylan Thomas  a 21 year old man  not the dead poet  was on vacation in Bali and woke up one morning to discover a red  trail  of irritation running from his navel to his chest  a trail that continued to grow longer throughout the day Thomas says that  after initially being sent home with antihistamines  he returned to the medical center where doctors discovered a tiny tropical spider beneath his skin Supposedly  they removed the creature through an incision and placed it in a specimen jar According to Thomas  his doctors speculated that it had entered his skin through an appendectomy scar and just kept moving up his body Thomas told various news outlets that he believes the spider was there for three days It s the kind of story that has a lot of people saying   NOPE  and a lot of arachnologists saying simply   No  that didn t happen Thomas may have been told that a spider invaded his flesh  but the arachnologists we spoke to about this story sincerely doubt that one actually did  I think this is extremely suspect  unusual  and likely not possible  Christopher Buddle  associate professor at McGill University s Department of Natural Resource Sciences  told us in an email  Simply put  it is not plausible and I can think of no valid reason why a spider might  crawl beneath skin through a scar The claim that it was  feeding and moving up through the scar tissue  defies logic and defies what we know about the biology of spiders I am also sceptical because the  evidence   the spider itself  is not presented Dr  Charles E  Griswold  Schlinger Curator of Arachnology  Emeritus  at the California Academy of Sciences  said he couldn t comment on this particular incident  but was similarly skeptical  I n general this is impossible and there is no reason that a spider would do that  he wrote Could it be that doctors pulled something other than a spider from Thomas  body Maybe  but we should wait to hear if more information comes out about the specimen Buddle told us   Other arthropods  e g  ticks mites perhaps some insects  could  possibly  be  associated  with something like this… perhaps But certainly not a spider Marie Herberstein  Head of the Department of Biological Sciences at Macquarie University in New South Wales  doesn t fully exclude the possibility that this could be a spider  though she writes   I have never heard of any spider to crawl or exist under the skin or integument of any other creature  there are no parasites amongst spiders But she also suspects it may be a different animal She told us   My initial reaction is that this is a mite  also 8 legged  rather than a spider  and mites are renown ed  for this type of behaviour  such as in scabies Let s see what the identification brings Top photo  An actual spider from Bali  taken by Lip Kee CC Attribution ShareAlike 2 0 ,1,3842
"Meteor Leaves 40 Foot Crater Near Managua s Airport An explosion and a crater reported near the capital of Nicaragua raised suspicions on Monday that a meteorite had split off from an asteroid that passed by Earth this weekend and struck our planet But NASA scientists have now cast doubt on whether the blast outside Managua was even a meteorite at all The blast left a hole 40 feet  12 meters  wide and 19 feet  5 meters  deep outside the international airport serving Nicaragua s capital Some Nicaraguan astronomers quoted in early news reports attributed the blast to a chip off a weekend asteroid flyby But outside meteorite experts later downplayed links to the small asteroid  dubbed 2014 RC  which passed harmlessly by Earth over the weekend About the size of a house  2014 RC passed within 22 000 miles  36 000 kilometers  of our planet on Sunday  Information is limited  but the miss distance of 2014 RC actually precludes any related meteorite impact  at the Managua crater  says MIT asteroid expert Richard Binzel  by email Managua Meteorite Managua residents reported the blast just after midnight In some news reports  geophysicist Wilfried Strauch of Nicaragua s Institute of Earth Studies attributed the crater to a meteorite impact However  NASA asteroid expert Don Yeomans  author of Near Earth Objects  Finding Them Before They Find Us  says that outside experts suspect the crater wasn t caused by an impact  This event was separated by 13 hours from the close Earth approach of 2014 RC  so the explosion and the asteroid are unrelated  says Yeomans  because the Earth moves about 870 000 miles  1 4 million kilometers  in 13 hours  There was no obvious optical fireball or debris trail seen prior to the explosion  so it seems unlikely that the explosion in Nicaragua was related to a meteorite impact Russian Roulette

Meteorite impacts have occurred at the same time unconnected asteroid flybys in the past  most notably in the February 15  2013  Chelyabinsk impact  which damaged buildings across central Russia  See  Chelyabinsk Meteor  The Animated Movie That meteorite impact sprang from an object roughly the size of 2014 RC exploding in the atmosphere above Russia  with about 500 kilotons of energy  bright enough to sunburn some watchers A larger asteroid had passed harmlessly over the Southern Hemisphere on the same date Update  In a late Monday report on RC 2014  astronomers at NASA s Near Earth Object Program based at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena  California  revised size estimates for the asteroid Radar observations indicate that the asteroid is about 40 feet  12 meters  across and rotates rapidly  several times a minute That makes it roughly half the size of the 2013 Russian meteorite The NASA update also called the meteorite report from Managua  unrelated  to RC 2014  citing the 13 hour difference in the asteroid flyby and the crater explosion  As yet  no eyewitness accounts or imagery have come to light of the fireball flash or debris trail that is typically associated with a meteor of the size required to produce such a crater  noted the statement ",1,3843
"Singing polar bear facing ASBO after noise complaint Central Bedfordshire Council has refuted newspaper reports which suggested it was about to issue an Anti Social Behaviour Order  Asbo  to a six foot mechanical bear The polar bear  named Bernard  is situated outside the Loft Cafe in Shefford and performs Christmas carols to passers by but a story in the Bedfordshire on Sunday newspaper suggested residents feared it “could be hit with an Asbo after receiving complaints” However  a press officer for the council told i100 co uk that the story was “embellished” and there had been “absolutely no mention of an Asbo or a gagging order  or anything like that” The council did acknowledge that one noise complaint had been made about the bear and council officers were therefore “legally obliged” to investigate it but subsequently deemed it not to be a nuisance We have received one complaint regards a Christmas carol singing bear and have visited the premises on a number of occasions and  while Bernard has not been deemed a nuisance  we have written to both parties  explaining the situation as part of an ongoing investigation The council takes noise complaints seriously and has a legal obligation to fully investigate them  but we also want everyone in Central Bedfordshire to enjoy themselves over the Christmas period and would urge residents and business owners alike to be mindful of their neighbours and the local community when planning festivities Central Bedfordshire Council statement
The story in the Bedfordshire on Sunday  which was picked up by the Metro and the BBC  has subsequently been updated with a small disclaimer at the end saying  “Central Bedfordshire Council would like to make clear no ABSO proceedings have been brought against Bernard nor has he officially been ‘gagged’ ”

Government guidelines say that anyone over the age of 10 can be given an Asbo for “drunken or threatening behaviour  vandalism and graffiti and playing loud music at night” Sadly  it makes no mention of mechanical polar bears or any other inanimate objects for that matter ",1,3844
